<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"><span class="fs135">INTRODUCTION</span></a></h2>


<p class="noindent">This series of English History Source Books is intended
for use with any ordinary textbook of English History.
Experience has conclusively shown that such apparatus is
a valuable&mdash;nay, an indispensable&mdash;adjunct to the history
lesson. It is capable of two main uses: either by way of
lively illustration at the close of a lesson, or by way of inference-drawing,
before the textbook is read, at the beginning
of the lesson. The kind of problems and exercises that may
be based on the documents are legion, and are admirably
illustrated in a <cite>History of England for Schools</cite>, Part I., by
Keatinge and Frazer, pp. 377-381. However, we have no
wish to prescribe for the teacher the manner in which he shall
exercise his craft, but simply to provide him and his pupils
with materials hitherto not readily accessible for school
purposes. The very moderate price of the books in this
series should bring them within the reach of every secondary
school. Source books enable the pupil to take a more active
part than hitherto in the history lesson. Here is the apparatus,
the raw material: its use we leave to teacher and
taught.</p>

<p>Our belief is that the books may profitably be used by all
grades of historical students between the standards of fourth-form
boys in secondary schools and undergraduates at Universities.
What differentiates students at one extreme from
those at the other is not so much the kind of subject-matter
dealt with, as the amount they can read into or extract
from it.</p>

<p>In regard to choice of subject-matter, while trying to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
satisfy the natural demand for certain "stock" documents
of vital importance, we hope to introduce much fresh and
novel matter. It is our intention that the majority of the
extracts should be lively in style&mdash;that is, personal, or descriptive,
or rhetorical, or even strongly partisan&mdash;and should
not so much profess to give the truth as supply data for inference.
We aim at the greatest possible variety, and lay
under contribution letters, biographies, ballads and poems,
diaries, debates, and newspaper accounts. Economics, London,
municipal, and social life generally, and local history,
are represented in these pages.</p>

<p>The order of the extracts is strictly chronological, each
being numbered, titled, and dated, and its authority given.
The text is modernised, where necessary, to the extent of
leaving no difficulties in reading.</p>

<p>We shall be most grateful to teachers and students who may
send us suggestions for improvement.</p>

<p><em>Serjeant Philips.</em> I hope to make this so clear, as that the
wit of man shall have no colour to answer it. The matter is
Treason in the highest degree, the end to deprive the king of
his crown. The particular Treasons are these: first to raise
up Rebellion, and to effect that, to procure Money; to raise
up Tumults in Scotland, by divulging a treasonable Book
against the king's right to the crown; the purpose, to take
away the life of his majesty and his issue. My lord Cobham
confesseth sir Walter to be guilty of all these Treasons. The
question is, whether he be guilty as joining with him, or
instigating of him? The course to prove this, was by lord
Cobham's Accusation. If that be true, he is guilty; if not,
he is clear. So whether Cobham say true, or Raleigh, that
is the question. Raleigh hath no answer but the shadow of
as much wit, as the wit of man can devise. He useth his
bare denial; the denial of a Defendant must not move the
Jury. In the Star Chamber, or in the Chancery, for matter
of Title, if the Defendant be called in question, his denial on
his oath is no Evidence to the Court to clear him; he doth it
in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">propria causa</i>; therefore much less in matters of Treason.
Cobham's testification against him before them, and since,
hath been largely discoursed.</p>

<p><em>Raleigh.</em> If truth be constant and constancy be in truth,
why hath he forsworn that that he hath said? You have
not proved any one thing against me by direct Proofs, but
all by circumstances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Coke (Attorney-General).</em> Have you done? The king must
have the last.</p>

<p><em>Raleigh.</em> Nay, Mr. Attorney, he which speaketh for his life,
must speak last. False repetitions and mistakings must not
mar my cause. You should speak <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">secundum allegata et
probata</i>. I appeal to God and the king in this point, whether
Cobham's Accusation be sufficient to condemn me.</p>

<p><em>Coke.</em> The king's safety and your clearing cannot agree.
I protest before God, I never knew a clearer Treason.</p>

<p><em>Raleigh.</em> I never had intelligence with Cobham since I came
to the Tower.</p>

<p><em>Coke.</em> Go to, I will lay thee upon thy back, for the confidentest
Traitor that ever came at a bar. Why should you
take 8,000 crowns for a peace?</p>

<p><em>Lord Cecil.</em> Be not so impatient, good Mr. Attorney, give
him leave to speak.</p>

<p><em>Coke.</em> If I may not be patiently heard, you will encourage
Traitors, and discourage us. I am the king's sworn servant,
and must speak; If he be guilty, he is a Traitor; if not,
deliver him.</p>

<p>[<em>Note.</em>&mdash;Here Mr. Attorney sat down in a chafe, and would
speak no more, until the Commissioners urged and intreated
him. After much ado, he went on, and made a long repetition
of all the Evidence, for the direction of the Jury; and at the
repeating of some things, sir Walter Raleigh interrupted
him, and said, he did him wrong.]</p>

<p><em>Coke.</em> Thou art the most vile and execrable Traitor that
ever lived.</p>

<p><em>Raleigh.</em> You speak indiscreetly, barbarously and uncivilly.</p>

<p><em>Coke.</em> I want words sufficient to express thy viperous
Treasons.</p>

<p><em>Raleigh.</em> I think you want words indeed, for you have
spoken one thing half a dozen times.</p>

<p><em>Coke.</em> Thou art an odious fellow, thy name is hateful to all
the realm of England for thy pride.</p>

<p><em>Raleigh.</em> It will go near to prove a measuring cast between
you and me, Mr. Attorney.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Coke.</em> Well, I will now make it appear to the world, that
there never lived a viler viper upon the face of the earth
than thou....</p>

<p><em>Dr. Reynolds.</em> I desire, that according to certain provincial
constitutions, the clergy may have meetings every three
weeks.&mdash;1. First in Rural Deaneries, therein to have prophesying,
as archbishop Grindall, and other bishops, desired
of her late majesty.&mdash;2. That such things as could not be
resolved on there, might be referred to the archdeacons'
visitations.&mdash;3. And so to the Episcopal Synod, to determine
such points before not decided.</p>

<p><em>His Majesty.</em> If you aim at a Scottish Presbytery, it agreeth
as well with monarchy, as God and the devil. Then Jack,
and Tom, and Will, and Dick, shall meet and censure me and
my council. Therefore I reiterate my former speech, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le
Roy s'avisera</i>; Stay, I pray, for one seven years, before you
demand, and then if you find me grow pursy and fat, I may,
perchance, hearken unto you, for that government will keep
me in breath, and give me work enough. I shall speak of one
matter more, somewhat out of order, but it skilleth not;
Dr. Reynolds, you have often spoken for my Supremacy, and
it is well: but know you any here, or elsewhere, who like
of the present government ecclesiastical, and dislike my
Supremacy?</p>

<p><em>Dr. Reyn.</em> I know none.</p>

<p><em>His Maj.</em> Why then I will tell you a tale: after that the
religion restored by king Edward the sixth, was soon overthrown
by queen Mary here in England, we in Scotland felt
the effect of it. For thereupon Mr. Knox writes to the queen
regent (a virtuous and moderate lady) telling her that she
was the supreme head of the Church; and charged her, as
she would answer it at God's tribunal, to take care of Christ
his Evangil, in suppressing the Popish prelates, who withstood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
the same; but how long trow you did this continue? Even
till by her authority the Popish bishops were repressed, and
Knox with his adherents, being brought in, made strong
enough. Then began they to make small account of her
supremacy, when, according to that more light, wherewith
they were illuminated, they made a further reformation of
themselves. How they used the poor lady my mother, is
not unknown, and how they dealt with me in my minority.
I thus apply it. My lords, the bishops, I may [This he said
putting his hand to his hat] thank you that these men plead
thus for my Supremacy. They think they cannot make their
good against you, but by appealing unto it; but if once you
were out, and they in, I know what would become of my
Supremacy, for <em>No Bishop, No King</em>. I have learned of what
cut they have been, who, preaching before me, since my
coming into England, passed over, with silence, my being
Supreme Governor in causes ecclesiastical. Well, doctor,
have you anything else to say?</p>

<p><em>Dr. Reyn.</em> No more, if it please your majesty.</p>

<p><em>His Maj.</em> If this be all your party hath to say, I will
make them conform themselves, or else I will harrie them
out of the land, or else do worse.</p>

<p>Thus ended the second day's Conference.</p>

<p>The state of monarchy is the supremest thing upon earth;
for kings are not only God's lieutenants upon earth, and sit
upon God's throne, but even by God himself they are called
gods. There be three principal similitudes that illustrate the
state of monarchy: one taken out of the word of God; and
the two other out of the grounds of policy and philosophy.
In the scriptures, kings are called gods; and so their power,
after a certain relation, compared to the divine power. Kings
are also compared to fathers of families: for a king is truly
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">parens patriæ</i>, the politique father of his people. And, lastly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
kings are compared to the head of this microcosm of the body
of man.</p>

<p>Kings are justly called gods; for that they exercise a
manner or resemblance of divine power upon earth. For,
if you will consider the attributes of God, you shall see how
they agree in the person of a king. God hath power to create
or destroy, make or unmake, at his pleasure; to give life or
send death, to judge all, and not to be judged nor accountable
to none; to raise low things, and to make high things low at
his pleasure, and to God are both soul and body due. And
the like power have kings: they make and unmake their
subjects; they have power of raising and casting down; of
life and of death; judges over all their subjects, and in all
causes, and yet accountable to none but God only. They
have power to exalt low things, and abase high things and
make of their subjects like men at the chess; a pawn to take a
bishop or a knight, and to cry up or down any of their subjects,
as they do their money. And to the king is due both the
affection of the soul and the service of the body of his subjects.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Niccolo Molin, Ambassador in England, to the Doge and Senate.</em></p>


<p>The King came to London on Thursday evening, the 10th
of this month, and made all preparations for opening Parliament
on Tuesday, the 15th. This would have taken place
had not a most grave and important event upset the arrangement.
About six months ago a gentleman, named Thomas
Percy, relation of the Earl of Northumberland and pensioner
of the King, hired, by means of a trusty servant, some wine
cellars under the place where Parliament meets, and stored
in them some barrels of beer, the usual drink of this country,
as well as wood and coal. He said he meant to open a tavern
for the use of servants who attended their masters to Parlia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>ment.
But among this beer, wood, and coals he introduced
thirty-three barrels of gunpowder, besides four tuns, the size
of Cretan hogsheads, intending to make use of it at the right
moment. About two months ago Lord Salisbury received
anonymous letters from France, warning him to be on his
guard, for a great conspiracy was being hatched by priests
and Jesuits; but, as similar information had been sent about
a year ago by the English lieger in France, no great attention
was paid to these letters, and they were attributed to the
empty-headed vanity of persons who wished to seem more
conversant with affairs than became them. Finally, on
Monday last, a letter was brought by an unknown person,
for it was dark, about two o'clock of the night, to a servant of
Lord Monteagle, who was standing at the door. The unknown
said, "Please give this to your master: and tell him
to reply at once, as I will come back in half an hour for the
answer to carry to my master." The servant took the letter,
and went upstairs and gave it to his master, who opened it
and found it was anonymous, nor did he recognize the hand.
The substance of the letter was this, that the writer, in return
for the favours received at various times from Lord Monteagle,
had resolved to warn him by letter that he should on
no account attend Parliament the following morning, as he
valued his life, for the good party in England had resolved to
execute the will of God, which was to punish the King ...
and the Ministers for their bitter persecution employed against
the poor [Catholics] ... in such brief space ... he could
burn the letter, which he earnestly begged him to do. Lord
Monteagle read the letter, and in great astonishment took it
to the Earl of Salisbury, who at once carried it to the King,
and under various pretexts ordered a search of all the neighbouring
houses to see if arms or anything of that sort, which
might furnish a clue, were hidden there. Meantime the King
read the letter, and in terrified amaze he said, "I remember
that my father died by gunpowder. I see the letter says the
blow is to be struck on a sudden. Search the basements of
the meeting-place." The Chamberlain, with three or four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
attendants, went straightway to carry out this order. First
he inquired who had hired the basements; then he caused the
door to be opened and went in. He saw nothing but beer
barrels, faggots and coal. Meantime, those who had searched
the neighbouring houses came back and reported that they
had found nothing of any importance, and when the Chamberlain
returned and reported that he, too, had seen nothing
but the barrels, faggots and coal this increased the alarm and
suspicions of the King, who said, "I don't like these faggots
and coal. Go back and shift all the wood and all the coal
and see what is underneath, and use all diligence to come to
certainty in the matter." The Chamberlain went back, and
after shifting the wood he found underneath some barrels of
powder, and after shifting the coal he found more barrels.
In confusion he returned to the King and told him; and orders
were at once given to a certain knight to take a company
with him and to set sentinels in various posts to watch who
approached the door of the cellars. About two in the morning
they saw a man approaching with a dark lantern, but not
so well closed as to hide the light completely. The guards
cunningly drew back and left him free passage to the cellars,
the door of which had been securely fastened as it was at
first. The man went in, laid a train of powder and fitted a
slow match; the powder and the tinder reached the powder
barrels. His intention was to fire the train in the morning.
When he had finished his business, as he was coming out, he
was surprised by the guard, who asked what [he was doing]
at that hour at that place. [He replied] that he had come
there, as he had a fancy to see his property. They saw a bag
in his hand, and found in it little bits of slow match, and when
they turned on the light they saw the train of powder. Thereupon
they bound him and took him to the Palace, where
some of the Council were awake, waiting the issue of this
affair. The man was brought into their presence, and at once
confessed that he was servant to Thomas Percy, who had
left the evening before, he knew not where for, and was quite
ignorant of these facts. He further confessed that it was his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
firm resolve to have set fire to the mine that morning while
the King, Queen, Princes, Clergy, Nobility, and Judges were
met in Parliament, and thus to purge the kingdom of perfidious
heresies. His only regret was that the discovery of
the plot had frustrated its due execution, though it was
certain that God would not for long endure such injustice
and iniquity. The rest in my next despatch.</p>

<p class="pfs90 smcap">Argument of Chief Baron Fleming.</p>

<p class="pfs90"><b>Source.</b>&mdash;<cite>State Trials.</cite> Vol. ii., p. 389.</p>


<p>To the king is committed the government of the realm and
his people; and Bracton saith, that for his discharge of his
office, God had given to him power, the act of government,
and the power to govern. The king's power is double,
ordinary and absolute, and they have several laws and ends.
That of the ordinary is for the profit of particular subjects,
for the execution of civil justice, the determining of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">meum</i>;
and this is exercised by equity and justice in ordinary courts,
and by the civilians is nominated <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus privatum</i> and with us,
common law: and these laws cannot be changed, without
parliament; and although that their form and course may be
changed, and interrupted, yet they can never be changed
in substance. The absolute power of the king is not that
which is converted or executed to private use, to the benefit
of any particular person, but is only that which is applied
to the general benefit of the people, and is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">salus populi</i>; as
the people is the body, and the king the head; and this power
is guided by the rules, which direct only at the common law,
and is most properly named Policy and Government; and
as the constitution of this body varieth with the time, so
varieth this absolute law, according to the wisdom of the king,
for the common good; and these being general rules and
true as they are, all things done within these rules are lawful.
The matter in question is material matter of state, and ought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
to be ruled by the rules of policy; and if it be so, the king
hath done well to execute his extraordinary power. All
customs, be they old or new, are no other but the effects and
issues of trades and commerce with foreign nations; but all
commerce and affairs with foreigners, all wars and peace, all
acceptance and admitting for current foreign coin, all parties
and treaties whatsoever, are made by the absolute power of
the king; and he who hath power of causes, hath power also
of effects. No exportation or importation can be, but at the
king's ports. They are the gates of the king, and he hath
absolute power by them to include or exclude whom he shall
please; and ports to merchants are their harbours, and repose;
and for their better security he is compelled to provide
bulwarks and fortresses, and to maintain, for the collection
of his customs and duties, collectors and customers; and for
that charge it is reason, that he should have this benefit.
He is also to defend the merchants from pirates at sea in their
passage. Also, by the power of the king they are to be
relieved, if they are oppressed by foreign princes, for they
shall have his treaty, and embassage; and if he be not
remedied thereby, then <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lex talionis</i> shall be executed, goods
for goods, and tax for tax; and if this will not redress the
matter, then war is to be attempted for the cause of merchants.
In all the king's courts, and of other princes, the judges in
them are paid by the king, and maintained by him to do
justice to the subjects, and therefore he hath the profits of
the said courts. It is reasonable that the king should have
as much power over foreigners and their goods, as over his
own subjects; and if the king cannot impose upon foreign
commodities a custom, as well as foreigners may upon their
own commodities, and upon the commodities of this land
when they come to them, then foreign states shall be enriched
and the king impoverished, and he shall not have equal
profit with them; and yet it will not be denied, but his power
herein is equal with other states.</p>

<p class="p2 pfs90 smcap">Mr. Yelverton's Argument.</p>

<p class="pfs90"><b>Source.</b>&mdash;<cite>State Trials.</cite> Vol. ii., p. 482.</p>

<p>For the first, it will be admitted for a rule and ground of
state, that in every commonwealth and government there be
some rights of sovereignty, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jura majestatis</i>, which regularly
and of common right do belong to the sovereign power of
that state; unless custom, or the provisional ordinance of that
state, do otherwise dispose of them: which sovereign power is
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">potestas suprema</i> a power that can control all other powers,
and cannot be controlled but of itself. It will not be denied,
that the power of imposing hath so great a trust in it, by reason
of the mischiefs may grow to the common-wealth by the
abuses of it, that it hath ever been ranked among those rights
of sovereign power. Then is there no further question to be
made, but to examine where the sovereign power is in this
kingdom; for there is the right of imposition. The sovereign
power is agreed to be in the king: but in the king is a twofold
power; the one is parliament, as he is assisted with the
consent of the whole state; the other out of parliament, as
he is sole, and singular, guided merely by his own will. And
if of these two powers in the king one is greater than the
other, and can direct and control the other; that is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">suprema
potestas</i>, the sovereign power, and the other is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">subordinata</i>.
It will then be easily proved, that the power of the king
in parliament is greater than his power out of parliament;
and doth rule and control it; for if the king make a grant by
his letters patents out of parliament, it bindeth him and his
successors: he cannot revoke it, nor any of his successors;
but by his power in parliament he may defeat and avoid it;
and therefore that is the greater power.</p>

<p>We lived in a country that had but little preaching at all.
In the village where I was born there were four readers successively
in six years' time, ignorant men and two of them
immoral in their lives, who were all my schoolmasters. In
the village where my father lived, there was a reader of about
eighty years of age that never preached and had two churches
about twenty miles distant; his eyesight failing him he said
Common prayer without book, but for the reading of the
psalms and chapters he got a common thresher and day
labourer one year, and a tailor another year (for the Clerk
could not read well). And at last he had a kinsman of his
own (the excellentest stage player in all the country and a
good gamester and good fellow) that got orders and supplied one
of his places. After him, another younger kinsman that could
write and read got orders. And at the same time another
neighbour's son that had been a while at school turned
minister, and who would needs go further than the rest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
ventured to preach (and after got a living in Staffordshire),
and when he had been a preacher about twelve or sixteen
years, he was fain to give over, it being discovered that his
orders were forged by the first ingenious stage player. And
after him another neighbour's son took orders, when he had
been a while an attorney's clerk and a common drunkard
and tippled himself into so great poverty that he had no
other way to live. These were the schoolmasters of my
youth (except two of them) who read Common prayer on
Sundays and holidays and taught school and tippled on the
weekdays and whipped the boys when they were drunk, so
that we changed them very often....</p>

<p>In the village where I lived the reader read the Common
prayer briefly, and the rest of the day even till dark night
almost, excepting eating time, was spent in dancing under a
maypole and a great tree, not far from my father's door,
where all the town did meet together. And though one of
my father's own tenants was the piper, he could not restrain
him nor break the sport, so that we could not read the
Scriptures in our family without the great disturbance of the
tabor and pipe and noise in the street. Many times my mind
was inclined to be among them and sometimes I broke loose
from conscience and joined with them, and the more I did
it the more I was inclined to it. But when I heard them call
my father Puritan, it did much to cure me and alienate me
from them, for I considered that my father's exercise of reading
the Scriptures was better than theirs and would surely be
better thought on by all men at the last. When I heard
them speak scornfully of others as Puritans whom I never
knew, I was at first apt to believe all the lies and slanders
wherewith they loaded them. But when I heard my own
Father so reproached and perceived the drunkards were the
forwardest in the reproach, I perceived that it was mere
malice. For my Father never scrupled Common prayer or
Ceremonies, nor spake against Bishops, nor ever so much as
prayed but by a book or form, being not ever acquainted
then with any that did otherwise. But only for reading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Scriptures when the rest were dancing on the Lord's Day,
and for praying (by a form out of the end of the Common
prayer Book) in his house, and for reproving drunkards and
swearers, and for talking sometimes a few words of Scripture
and the Life to come, he was reviled commonly by the name
of Puritan, Precisian, and Hypocrite, and so were the godly
conformable ministers that lived anywhere in the country
near us, not only by our neighbours, but by the common
talk of the vulgar rabble of all about us. By this experience
I was fully convinced that Godly People were the best, those
that despised them and lived in sin and pleasure were a
malignant unhappy sort of people; and this kept me out of
their Company, except now and then when the love of sports
and play enticed me.</p>

<p>Whereas, upon our return the last year out of Scotland,
we did publish our pleasure, touching the recreations of our
people in those parts, under our hand; for some causes us
thereunto moving, we have thought good to command these
our directions, then given in Lancashire (with a few words
thereunto added, and most applicable to these parts of our
realms), to be published to all our subjects.</p>

<p>Whereas we did justly, in our progress through Lancashire,
rebuke some Puritans and precise people, and took order,
that the like unlawful carriage should not be used by any of
them hereafter, in the prohibiting and unlawful punishing of
our good people, for using their lawful recreations and honest
exercises, upon Sundays and other holidays, after the afternoon
sermon or service: we now find, that two sorts of people,
wherewith that country is much infected (we mean Papists
and Puritans) have maliciously traduced and calumniated
those our just and honourable proceedings: and therefore,
lest our reputation might, upon the one side (though innocently),
have some aspersion laid upon it; and upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
other part, our good people in that country be misled, by the
mistaking and misinterpretation of our meaning; we have
therefore thought good, hereby to clear and make our pleasure
to be manifested to all our good people in those parts.</p>

<p>It is true, that at our first entry to this crown and kingdom,
we were informed (and that too truly) that our county of
Lancashire abounded more in popish recusants, than any
county of England, and thus hath still continued since, to our
great regret, with little amendment; save that now of late,
in our last riding through our said country, we find, both by
the report of the judges, and of the bishops of that diocese,
that there is some amendment now daily beginning; which is
no small contentment to us.</p>

<p>The report of this growing amendment amongst them made
us the more sorry, when, with our own ears, we heard the
general complaint of our people, "That they were barred from
all lawful recreation and exercise upon the Sunday's afternoon,
after the ending of all divine service"; which cannot
but produce two evils: the one, the hindering of the conversion
of many, whom their priests will take occasion hereby to vex;
persuading them, that no honest mirth or recreation is lawful,
or tolerable, in our religion; which cannot but breed a great
discontentment in our people's hearts, especially of such as
are, peradventure, upon the point of turning. The other
inconvenience is, that this prohibition barreth the common
and meaner sort of people from using such exercises, as may
make them bodies more able for war, when we, or our successors
shall have occasion to use them; and, in place thereof,
sets up filthy tipplings and drunkenness, and breeds a number
of idle and discontented speeches in their alehouses: for when
shall the common people have leave to exercise, if not upon
the Sundays and holidays? Seeing they must apply their
labour, and win their living in all working-days.</p>

<p>Our express pleasure therefore is, that the laws of our
kingdom, and canons of our church, be as well observed in
that county, as in all other places of this our kingdom; and,
on the other part, that no lawful recreation shall be barred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
to our good people, which shall not tend to the breach of our
aforesaid laws, and canons of our church: which to express
more particularly, our pleasure is, that the bishops, and all
other inferior churchmen, and churchwardens shall, for their
parts, be careful and diligent, both to instruct the ignorant,
and convince and reform them that are misled in religion;
presenting them that will not conform themselves, but
obstinately stand out, to our judges and justices; whom we
likewise command to put the law in due execution against
them.</p>

<p>Our pleasure likewise is, that the bishop of that diocese
take the like strait order with all the Puritans and Precisians
within the same; either constraining them to conform themselves,
or to leave the county, according to the laws of our
kingdom, and canons of our church; and so to strike equally,
on both hands, against the contemners of our authority, and
adversaries of our church. And as for our good people's
lawful recreation, our pleasure likewise is, that after the end
of divine service, our good people be not disturbed, letted, or
discouraged, from any lawful recreation, such as dancing,
either men or women; archery for men, leaping, vaulting, or
any such harmless recreation; nor from having of May-games,
Whitson-ales, and Morrice-dances; and the setting up of May-poles,
and other sports therewith used, so as the same be
had in due and convenient time, without impediment or
neglect of divine service; and that women shall have leave
to carry rushes to the church, for the decoring of it, according
to their old custom. But, withal, we do here account still
as prohibited, all unlawful games to be used upon Sundays
only; as bear and bull baitings, interludes, and, at all times,
(in the meaner sort of people by law prohibited) bowling.</p>

<p>And likewise we bar, from this benefit and liberty, all such
known Recusants, either men or women, as will abstain from
coming to church or divine service; being therefore unworthy
of any lawful recreation after the said service, that will not
first come to the church and serve God: prohibiting, in like
sort, the said recreations to any that, though conform in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
religion, are not present in the church, at the service of God,
before their going to the said recreations. Our pleasure likewise
is, that they to whom it belongeth in office, shall present,
and sharply punish all such as, in abuse of this our liberty,
will use these exercises before the ends of all divine services,
for that day. And we likewise straitly command, that every
person shall resort to his own parish-church to hear divine
service, and each parish by itself to use the said recreation
after divine service; prohibiting likewise any offensive
weapons to be carried, or used in the said times of recreations.</p>

<p>Fourthly, for that which may concern the sovereign and
estate. Judges ought above all to remember the conclusion
of the Twelve Tables, "Salus populi suprema lex"; and to
know that laws, except they be in order to that end, are but
things captious, and oracles not well inspired. Therefore it
is a happy thing in a state when kings and states do often
consult with judges; and again when judges do often consult
with the king and state; the one, when there is matter of
law intervement in business of state; the other, when there is
some consideration of state intervement in matter of law.
For many times the things deduced to judgment may be
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">meum</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tuum</i>, when the reason and consequence thereof
may trench to point of estate: I call matter of estate, not only
the parts of sovereignty, but whatsoever introduceth any
great alteration or dangerous precedent; or concerneth manifestly
any great portion of people. And let no man weakly
conceive that just laws and true policy have any antipathy;
for they are like the spirits and sinews, that one moves with
the other. Let judges also remember, that Solomon's throne
was supported by lions on both sides: let them be lions, but
yet lions under the throne; being circumspect that they do
not check or oppose any points of sovereignty. Let not judges
also be so ignorant of their own right, as to think there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
not left to them, as a principal part of their office, a wise use
and application of laws. For they may remember what the

lex bona est, modo quis ea utatur legitime."</p>

<p>These troubles being blown over, and now all being compact
together in one ship, they put to sea again with a
prosperous wind, which continued diverse days together,
which was some encouragement unto them: yet according to
the usual manner, many were afflicted with sea sickness.
And I may not omit here a special work of God's Providence.
There was a proud and very profane young man, one of the
seamen, of a lusty, able body, which made him the more
haughty; he would always be contemning the poor people
in their sickness, and cursing them daily with grievous
execrations, and did not let to tell them that he hoped to
help to cast half of them overboard, before they came to their
journey's end, and to make merry with what they had; and if
he were by any gently reproved, he would curse and swear
most bitterly. But it pleased God before they came half seas
over, to smite this young man with a grievous disease, of
which he died in a desperate manner, and so was himself the
first that was thrown overboard. Thus his curses light on
his own head; and it was an astonishment to all his fellows,
for they noted it to be the just hand of God upon him.</p>

<p>After they had enjoyed fair winds and weather for a season,
they were encountered many times with cross winds, and
met with many fierce storms, with which the ship was shrewdly
shaken and her upper parts made very leaky. And one of
the main beams in the midships was bowed and cracked,
which put them in some fear that the ship could not be able
to perform the voyage. So some of the chief of the company,
perceiving the mariners to fear the sufficiency of the
ship, as appeared by their mutterings, entered into serious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
consultation with the master and other officers of the ship,
to consider in time of the danger; and rather to return than
to cast themselves into a desperate and inevitable peril.
And truly there was great distraction and difference of
opinion among the mariners themselves; fain would they do
what could be done for their wages' sake (being now half the
seas over,) and on the other hand they were loath to hazard
their lives too desperately. But in examining of all opinions,
the master and others affirmed they knew the ship to be
strong and firm under water; and for the buckling of the main
beam, there was a great iron screw the passengers brought
out of Holland, which would raise the beam into his place;
the which being done, the carpenter and master affirmed
that with a post put under it, set firm in the lower deck, and
otherways bound, he would make it sufficient. And as for
the decks and upper works, they would caulk them as well as
they could, and though with the working of the ship they
would not long keep staunch, yet there would otherwise be no
great danger, if they did not overpress her with sails. So they
committed themselves to the will of God and resolved to
proceed. In sundry of these storms the winds were so fierce
and the seas so high as they could not bear a knot of sail,
but were forced to drift for diverse days together. And in
one of them as they thus lay at drift in a mighty storm, a
lusty young man (called John Howland,) coming upon some
occasion above the gratings, was, with a roll of the ship, thrown
into the sea, but it pleased God that he caught hold of the
topsail halyards, which hung overboard and ran out at length;
yet he held his hold (though he was sundry fathoms under
water) till he was hauled up by the same rope to the brim of
the water, and then with a boat-hook and other means got
into the ship again, and his life saved; and though he was
something ill with it, yet he lived many years after; and
became a profitable member both in church and commonwealth.
In all this voyage there died but one of the passengers,
which was William Butten, a youth, servant to Samuel Fuller,
when they drew near the coast. But to omit other things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
(that I may be brief,) after long beating at sea they fell in with
that land which is called Cape Cod; the which being made and
certainly known to be it, they were not a little joyful. After
some deliberation had among themselves and with the master
of the ship, they tacked about and resolved to stand for the
southward (the wind and weather being fair) to find some
place about Hudson's river for their habitation. But after
they had sailed that course about half a day, they fell among
dangerous shoals and roaring breakers, and they were so
far entangled therewith as they conceived themselves in great
danger: and the wind shrinking upon them withal, they
resolved to bear up again for the Cape, and thought themselves
happy to get out of those dangers before night overtook
them, as by God's providence they did. And the next
day they got into the Cape Harbour, where they rode in
safety.</p>

<p>Being thus arrived in a good harbour and brought safe to
land, they fell upon their knees and blessed the God of
heaven, who had brought them over the vast and furious
ocean, and delivered them from all the perils and miseries
thereof, again to set their feet on the firm and stable earth,
their proper element.</p>

<p>The Commons now assembled in Parliament, being justly
occasioned thereunto, concerning sundry Liberties, Franchises,
and Privileges of Parliament, amongst others here mentioned,
do make this Protestation following: That the Liberties,
Franchises, Privileges, and Jurisdictions of Parliament are
the ancient and undoubted Birthright and Inheritance of the
subjects of England; and that the arduous and urgent
affairs concerning the King, State and Defence of the Realm,
and of the Church of England, and the maintenance and
making of Laws, and redress of mischiefs and grievances which
daily happen within this Realm, are proper subjects and matter
of Counsel and Debate in Parliament; and that in the handling
and proceeding of those businesses, every Member of the
House of Parliament hath, and of right ought to have, freedom
of speech to propound, treat, reason, and bring to conclusion
the same. And that the Commons in Parliament
have like liberty and freedom to treat of these matters in
such order as in their judgments shall seem fittest. And that
every member of the said House hath like freedom from all
Impeachment, Imprisonment, and Molestation (otherwise than
by Censure of the House itself) for or concerning any speaking,
reasoning, or declaring of matters touching the Parliament,
or Parliament-business. And that if any of the said members
be complained of and questioned for anything done or said
in Parliament, the same is to be showed to the King by the
advice and assent of all the commons assembled in Parliament,
before the King give credence to any private information.</p>

<p><em>His Majesty did this present day in full assembly of his
Council and in the presence of the Judges, declare the said
Protestation to be invalid, annulled, void, and of no effect.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
And did further <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">manu sua propria</span> take the said Protestation

<p><span class="smcap">Right noble and my most honoured Lord</span>,<br />
<span class="pad3">This</span> bearer, Sir William Russell, hath lately done his
Majesty good service by lending money towards the discharge
of the ships that come from Argier, whereof I pray your
Lordship to take notice and to thank him.</p>

<p>The more I look into the King's estate, the greater cause I
have to be troubled, considering the work I have to do, which
is not to reform one particular, as in the household, navy,
wardrobe, etc.; but every particular, as well of his Majesty's
receipts as payments, hath been carried with so much disadvantage
to the King, as until your Lordship see it you will
not believe any men should be so careless and unfaithful.</p>

<p>I have heard his Majesty is now granting a pension. I
pray your Lordship to consider how impossible it is for me
to do service if any such thing be done, and withal whether
it were not unjust to stop pensions already granted, and at the
same instant to grant new, and what a life I should have with
those whose pensions are stayed, for whom I have now a good
answer: viz., the King must and shall be first served. I pray
your lordship not only to stay the granting any new, but to
move his Majesty not to suffer any old to be exchanged or
altered from one life to another; and then, I dare assure your
Lordship, within these few months they will not be worth
two years' purchase.</p>

<p>I shall not desire to live if I do not the work; and therefore,
good my Lord, be constant yourself, and be the happy means
to hold the King so. It is my gratitude to his Majesty and
your lordship that hath engaged me: otherwise there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
nothing upon this earth could have tempted me to have
quit the happy estate I was in within these fourteen days,
to enter into a business so full of continual vexation and
trouble.</p>

<p>I have called some men to account who have not accounted
these seven years. I doubt some will make their addresses
to his Majesty or your lordship; I pray let their answer be,
his Majesty hath referred the trust of ordering his estate to
me.</p>

<p>I shall shortly call for an account out of the Isle of Wight.
I think out of moneys owing by some rich lords to pay some
of his Majesty's poor servants. I will spare no person, nor
forbear any course that is just and honourable to make our
great and gracious master to subsist of his own. The pains
and envy shall be mine: the honour and thanks your lordship's.
Wherefore be constant to him that loves and honours
you, and will ever rest,</p>

<p>The King's most Excellent Majesty, having taken knowledge
of the present scarcity and dearth, of the high prices
of corn and grain throughout all parts of this kingdom, hath
been pleased, by his Proclamation lately published, to restrain
the residence of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal and of the
Knights and Gentlemen of quality, in and near the cities of
London and Westminster and other cities and towns, to
return them unto their own houses and habitations in their
several countries, that all parts of the kingdom might find
the fruits and feel the comfort of their hospitality and good
government, wherein as his Majesty is well pleased with the
dutiful obedience of great numbers, that according to his
royal command have left the cities of London and West<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>minster
and the parts adjacent, so his Highness hath great
cause to condemn the obstinacy of all such as, in a time of
such general conformity, and against so many good Examples
shall show themselves refractory to that his royal pleasure
grounded upon important reasons of justice and state, and
therefore his Majesty <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'doth esfsoones'">doth eftsoones</ins> admonish them speedily
to submit themselves to that his Royal Proclamation, or else
to expect the severity of his justice for their wilful contempt,
and this his Majesty declares to be extended, as well unto
such as have repaired or shall repair from their ordinary
dwellings in the country unto their cities and towns, as unto
the cities of London and Westminster, and as well unto
widows as men of quality and estate, and to be continued not
only during the time of Christmas now instant, but in that
and all other times and seasons of this and other years until
his Majesty declare his pleasure otherwise; his Majesty intending
to continue this course hereafter for the general
good of his people, yet allowing that liberty which always
hath been in terms and otherwise to repair to London
about their necessary occasions, but not to remove their
wives and families from their ordinary habitations in the
country, an innovation and abuse lately crept in and grown
frequent.</p>

<p>And although his Majesty is persuaded that by this way
of reviving the laudable and ancient housekeeping of this
realm, the poor and such as are most pinched in times of
scarcity and want, will be much relieved and comforted, yet
that nothing may be omitted that may tend to their succour
and help, his Highness in his gracious and princely care and
providence, hath caused certain politic and good orders heretofore
made upon like occasions to be reviewed and published;
intitled, <cite>Orders appointed by his Majesty, &amp;c.</cite> By which the
Justices of Peace in all Parts of the Realm are directed to
stay all ingrossers forestallers and regrators of corn, and to
direct all owners and farmers, having corn to spare, to furnish
the Markets rateably and weekly with such quantities as
reasonably they may and ought to do, and some one or more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>

and to see divers other Articles observed and performed
tending to the prevention and remedy of this inconvenience....</p>

<p>The King's most Excellent Majesty considering the scarcity
of money and coin of late years grown within the realm,
occasioned partly by transportation thereof out of this kingdom,
and partly by the unlawful consumption thereof within
the land, whereof many unsufferable inconveniences do daily
arise, and more are like to ensue to the general hurt and
damage of the whole Commonweal, if some timely and good
Statutes made in the time of his most noble progenitors and
predecessors kings of this realm, as also the several Proclamations
published by his own royal authority since the beginning
of his most happy reign, notwithstanding all of which,
and some remarkable Examples of Justice in his High Court
of Star Chamber against some principal offenders in this kind,
many covetous and greedy persons have and daily do with
great boldness and contempt continue and proceed in those
unlawful and offensive courses, tending to the exhausting of
the treasure of the realm, and utter overthrow of trade and
commerce within the same.</p>

<p>And therefore his Majesty in his princely wisdom and upon
necessity of state, sees it fit that from henceforth all care and
diligence in the discovery and all severity in the correction
and punishment of such delinquents without favour to any
shall be used; and to the end that all men may take notice
hereof, his Majesty thinketh fit to publish this his Proclamation,
to the end that no man upon hope of impunity presume
hereafter to transgress his Majesty's laws or this his royal
commandment in that behalf; hereby straitly charging and
commanding that no person or persons alien, denizen, or
other subject of what estate quality or condition soever, do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>

carry or convey, or attempt or endeavour to transport carry
or convey out of this realm any gold or silver, either in coin,
plate, vessels, jewels, goldsmiths' work, bullion or other mass,
or otherwise howsoever, upon pain of his Majesty's heavy
indignation and displeasure, and of the severest censure of his
High Court of Star Chamber, and such further pains punishments
and imprisonments as by the laws and statutes of this
realm may be inflicted upon them for such their offence....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Excellent Lord</span>,<br />

<span class="pad3">Though</span> I have troubled your Lordship with many
letters, oftener than I think I should (save that affection
keepeth no account,) yet upon the repair of Mr. Matthew, a
gentleman so much your Lordship's servant, and to me
another myself, as your Lordship best knoweth, you would not
have thought me a man alive, except I had put a letter into
his hand, and withal by so faithful and approved a mean
commended my fortunes afresh unto your Lordship.</p>

<p>My Lord, to speak my heart to your Lordship, I never felt
my misfortunes so much as now, not for that part which may
concern myself, who profit (I thank God for it) both in
patience, and in settling mine own courses. But when I look
abroad, and see the times so stirring, and so much dissimulation,
falsehood, baseness and envy in the world, and so many
idle clocks going in men's heads; then it grieveth me much, that
I am not sometimes at your Lordship's elbow, that I might
give you some of the fruits of the careful advice, modest
liberty, and true information of a friend that loveth your
Lordship as I do. For though your Lordship's fortunes be
above the thunder and storms of inferior regions, yet never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>theless
to hear the wind and not to feel it will make one sleep
the better.</p>

<p>My good Lord, somewhat have I been and much have I
read: so that few things that concern states or greatness are
new cases unto me. And therefore I hope I may be no unprofitable
servant unto your Lordship. I remember the
King was wont to make a character of me, far above my
worth, that I was not made for small matters; and your
Lordship would sometimes bring me from his Majesty that
Latin sentence, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">De minimis non curat lex</i>: and it hath so
fallen out that since my retiring, times have been fuller of
great matters than before: wherein perhaps, if I had continued
near his Majesty, he mought have found more use of
my service, if my gift lay that way. But that is but a vain
imagination of mine. True it is, that as I do not aspire to use
my talent in the King's great affairs; yet for that which may
concern your Lordship, and your fortune, no man living shall
give you a better account of faith, industry, and affection
than I shall. I must conclude with that which gave me
occasion of this letter, which is Mr. Matthew's employment
to your Lordship in those parts. Wherein I am verily persuaded
your Lordship shall find him a wise and able gentleman,
and one that will bend his knowledge of the world
(which is great) to serve his Majesty, and the Prince, and in
especial your Lordship. So I rest,</p>

<span class="pad3">Though</span> your baby himself had sent word what need
he hath of more jewels, yet will I by this bearer, who can
make more speed than Carlile, again acquaint your Majesty
therewith, and give my poor and saucy opinion what will be
fittest more to send. Hitherto you have been so sparing that
whereas you thought to have sent him sufficiently for his
own wearing, to present his mistress, who I am sure shall
shortly now lose that title, and to lend me, that I on the contrary
have been forced to lend him. You need not ask who
made me able to do it. Sir, he hath neither chain nor hatband; and I beseech you consider first how rich they are in
jewels here, then in what a poor equipage he came in, how
he hath no other means to appear like a King's son, how they
are usefullest at such a time as this when they may do yourself,
your son, and the nation honour, and lastly how it will
neither cost nor hazard you anything. These reasons, I hope,
since you have ventured already your chiefest jewel, your
son, will serve to persuade you to let loose these more after
him: first, your best hatband; the Portingall diamond; the
rest of the pendant diamonds, to make up a necklace to give
his mistress; and the best rope of pearl; with a rich chain or
two for himself to wear&mdash;or else your Dog must want a collar;
which is the ready way to put him into it. There are many
other jewels which are of so mean quality as they deserve not
that name, but will save much in your purse and serve very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
well for presents. They had never so good and great an
occasion to take the air out of their boxes as at this time.
God knows when they shall have such another; and they had
need some time to get nearer the Son to continue them in
their perfection. Here give me leave humbly on my knees
to give your Majesty thanks for that rich jewel you sent me
in a box by my Lord Vaughan, and give him leave to kiss
your hands from me who took the pains to draw it. My
reward to him is this, he spent his time well, which is the thing
we should all most desire; and is the glory I covet most here
in your service.</p>

<p>Sir, four Asses I have sent you, two he's and two she's;
five camels, two he's, two she's, with a young one; and one
Elephant, which is worth your seeing. These I have impudently
begged for you. There is a Barbary horse comes
with them, I think from Watt Aston. My Lord Bristow says
he will send you more Camels. When we come ourselves we
will bring you horses and asses enough. If I may know
whether you desire Mules or not, I will bring them, or Deer
of this country either. And I will lay wait for all the rare-coloured

<p>With the former letter written by Mr. Shirley there were
sent sundry objections ... made by some of those that came
over on their own account and were returned home. I shall
set them down here, with the answers then made unto them
and sent over at the return of this ship, which did so confound
the objectors as some confessed their fault and others denied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
what they had said and ate their words, and some others of
them have since come over again and here lived.</p>

<p>The first objection was diversity about Religion. Answer:
We know no such matter, for here was never any controversy
or opposition (either public or private) (to our knowledge,)
since we came.</p>

<p>2 <em>ob.</em> Neglect of family duties, on the Lord's Day. Ans.:
We allow no such thing, but blame it in ourselves and others;
and they that thus report it, would have showed their
Christian love the more if they had told the offenders of it,
rather than thus to reproach them behind their backs. But
(to say no more) we wish themselves had given better
example.</p>

<p>3 <em>ob.</em> Want of both Sacraments. Ans.: The more is our
grief that our pastor is kept from us, by whom we might enjoy
them; for we used to have the Lord's Supper every Sabbath,
and baptism as often as there was occasion of children to
baptize.</p>

<p>4 <em>ob.</em> Children not catechised nor taught to read. Ans.:
Neither is true; for divers take pains with their own as they
can; indeed, we have no common school for want of a fit
person, or hitherto means to maintain one, though we desire
now to begin.</p>

<p>5 <em>ob.</em> Many of the particular members of the plantation will
not work for the general. Ans.: This also is not wholly
true; for though some do it not willingly and others not
honestly, yet all do it, and he that doth worst gets his own
food and something besides. But we will not excuse them,
but labour to reform them the best we can, or else to quit the
plantation of them.</p>

<p>6 <em>ob.</em> The water is not wholesome. Ans.: If they mean,
not so wholesome as the good beer and wine in London,
(which they so dearly love,) we will not dispute with them;
but else, for water, it is as good as any in the world (for aught
we know,) and it is wholesome enough to us that can be content
therewith.</p>

<p>7 <em>ob.</em> The ground is barren and doth bear no grass. Ans.:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
it is here as in all places, some better and some worse; and
if they will well consider their words, in England they shall not
find such grass in them as in their fields and meadows. The
cattle find grass, for they are as fat as need be; we wish we
had but one for every hundred that here is graze to keep.
Indeed this objection, as some others, are ridiculous to all
here which see and know the contrary.</p>

<p>8 <em>ob.</em> The fish will not take salt to keep sweet. Ans.:
This is as true as that which was written, that there is scarcely
a fowl to be seen, nor a fish to be taken. Things likely to be
true in a country where so many sail of ships come yearly for
the fishing! they might as well say, there can no ale or beer
in London be kept from souring.</p>

<p>9 <em>ob.</em> Many of them are thievish and steal one from another.
Ans.: Would that London had been free from that crime:
then we should not have been troubled with these here;
it is well known sundry have smarted well for it, and so are
the rest like to do, if they be taken.</p>

<p>10 <em>ob.</em> The country is annoyed with foxes and wolves.
Ans.: So are many other good countries too; but poison,
traps and other such means will help to destroy them.</p>

<p>11 <em>ob.</em> The Dutch are planted near Hudson's River, and are
likely to overthrow the trade. Ans.: They will come and
plant in these parts also, if we and others do not, but go
home and leave it to them. We rather commend them than
condemn them for it.</p>

<p>12 <em>ob.</em> The people are much annoyed with mosquitoes.
Ans.: They are too delicate and unfit to begin new plantations
and colonies, that cannot endure the biting of a mosquito:
we would wish such to keep at home till at least they
be mosquito proof. Yet this place is as free as any, and
experience teacheth that the more the land is tilled and the
woods cut down, the fewer there will be, and in the end
scarce any at all.</p>

<p>... Concerning the Duke of Buckingham, his Majesty hath
commanded me to tell you that himself doth know better
than any man living the sincerity of the Duke's proceedings;
with what cautions of weight and discretion he hath been
guided in his public employments from his Majesty and his

abroad; what perils of his person and hazard of his estate
he ran into for the service of his Majesty, and his ever blessed

House many times since his return from Spain. And therefore
his Majesty cannot believe that the aim is at the Duke of Buckingham,
but findeth that these Proceedings do directly wound
the honour and judgment of himself and of his Father. It is
therefore his Majesty's express and final commandment that
you yield obedience unto those directions which you have
formally received, and cease this unparliamentary inquisition,

the future reformation of these things which you suppose to

<p>Now concerning your Majesty's servants, and namely the
Duke of Buckingham: We humbly beseech your Majesty to
be informed by us your faithful Commons, who can have no
private end but your Majesty's service, and the good of our
country, that it hath been the ancient constant and undoubted
right and usage of Parliaments to question and complain
of all persons, of what degree soever, found grievous to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Commonwealth, in abusing the power and trust committed to
them by their sovereign. A course approved not only by
the examples in your Father's days of famous memory, but
by frequent precedents in the best and most glorious reigns
of your noble progenitors, appearing both in records and histories;
without which liberty in Parliament no private man,
no servant to a king, perhaps no counsellor, without exposing
himself to the hazard of great enmity and prejudice, can be a
means to call great officers in question for their misdemeanours,

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,<br />

<span class="pad3">Yesterday</span> was a day of desolation among us in Parliament,
and this day we fear will be the day of our dissolution:
Upon Tuesday Sir John Eliot moved, that as we intended to
furnish his Majesty with money, we should also supply him
with Counsel, which was one part of the occasion why we were
sent by the Country, and called for by his Majesty; And
since that House was the greatest Council of the Kingdom,
where, or when should His Majesty have better Council than
from thence? So he desired there might be a Declaration made
to the King of the danger wherein the Kingdom stood by
the decay and contempt of Religion, the insufficiency of his
Generals, the unfaithfulness of his Officers, the weakness of
his Councils, the exhausting of his Treasure, the death of his
Men, the decay of Trade, the loss of Shipping, the many and
powerful Enemies, the few and the poor Friends we had
abroad.</p>

<p>In the enumerating of which, the Chancellor of the Duchy
said it was a strange language, yet the House commanded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Sir John Eliot to go on. Then the Chancellor desired if he went
on, that himself might go out, whereupon they all bade him
be gone, yet he stayed and heard him out, and the House
generally inclined to such a Declaration to be presented in an
humble and modest manner, not prescribing the King the
way, but leaving it to his Judgment for reformation. So the
next day, being Wednesday, we had a Message from his
Majesty by the Speaker that the Session should end on
Wednesday, and that therefore we should husband the time,
and despatch the old businesses without entertaining new....
The House was much affected to be so restrained, since the
House in former times had proceeded by finding and committing
John of Gaunt the King's Son and others, and of late
have meddled with, and sentenced the Lord Chancellor Bacon,
and the Lord Treasurer Cranfield. Then Sir Robert Philips
spake, and mingled his words with weeping. Mr. Prynne did
the like, and Sir Edward Coke, overcome with passion, seeing
the desolation likely to ensue, was forced to sit down when he
began to speak, through the abundance of tears, yea, the
Speaker in his Speech could not refrain from weeping and
shedding of tears; besides a great many whose great griefs
made them dumb and silent, yet some bore up in that storm
and encouraged others. In the end they desired the Speaker
to leave the Chair, and Mr. Whitby was to come into it, that
they might speak the freer and the frequenter, and commanded
that no man go out of the House upon pain of going
to the Tower. Then the Speaker humbly and earnestly besought
the House to give him leave to absent himself for half
an hour, presuming they did not think he did it for any ill
intention; which was instantly granted him; then upon
many Debates about their Liberties hereby infringed, and
the imminent danger wherein the Kingdom stood, Sir Edward
Coke told them, he now saw God had not accepted of their
humble and moderate carriages and fair proceedings, and the
rather, because he thought they dealt not sincerely with the
King, and with the Country in making a true Representation
of the causes of all these miseries, which now he repented him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>self
since things were come to this pass, that he did it not
sooner, and therefore he not knowing whether ever he should
speak in this House again, would now do it freely, and there
protested that the author and cause of all those miseries was
the Duke of Buckingham, which was entertained and answered
with a cheerful acclamation of the House, as when one good
Hound recovers the scent, the rest come in with a full cry:
so they pursued it, and every one came on home, and laid
the blame where they thought the fault was, and as they were
Voting it to the question whether they should name him in
their intended Remonstrance, the sole or the Principal cause
of all their Miseries at home and abroad: The Speaker having
been three hours absent, and with the King, returned with
this Message; That the House should then rise (being about
eleven a clock, and no Committees should sit in the afternoon)
till to-morrow morning; What we shall expect this morning
God of Heaven knows. We shall meet timely this morning,
partly for the business sake, and partly because two days
since we made an Order, that whosoever comes in after
prayers, pays twelve pence to the poor. Sir, excuse my haste,
and let us have your prayers, whereof both you and we have
here need: So in scribbling haste I rest,</p>

<p>Whereas it is declared and enacted by a statute made in the
time of the reign of King Edward I., commonly called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Statutum
de tallagio non concedendo</i>, that no tallage or aid shall
be laid or levied by the King or his heirs in this realm, without
the good will and assent of the archbishops, bishops, earls,
barons, knights, burgesses and other the freemen of the commonalty
of this realm; and by authority of the Parliament
holden the five and twentieth year of the reign of King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Edward III., it is decreed and enacted: that from henceforth
no person should be compelled to make any loans to the King
against his will, because such loans were against reason, and
the franchise of the land. And by other laws of this realm, it
is provided, that none should be charged by any charge or
imposition called a benevolence, nor by such like charge, by
which the statutes aforementioned, and other the good laws
and statutes of this realm, your subjects have inherited this
freedom that they should not be compelled to contribute to
any tax, tallage, or other the like charge, not set by common
consent in parliament.</p>

<p>Yet nevertheless of late, divers commissions directed to
sundry commissioners in several counties with instructions,
have issued, by means whereof your people have been in
divers places assembled, and required to lend certain sums of
money unto your Majesty, and [some] of them, upon their
refusal so to do, have had an oath administered unto them,
not warrantable by the laws or statutes of this realm, and
have been constrained to become bound to make appearance,
and give attendance before your privy council and in other
places: and others of them have been therefore imprisoned,
confined and sundry other ways molested and disquieted.
And divers other charges have been levied upon your people
in several counties, by lord lieutenants, deputy lieutenants,
commissioners for musters, justices of the peace, and others
by command of or direction from your majesty, or your
privy council, against the laws and free customs of the realm.</p>

<p>And whereas by the Statute called the Great Charter of
the Liberties of England, it is declared and enacted, that no
freeman may be taken or imprisoned, or be disseised of his
freehold, or liberties, or his free customs, or be outlawed, or
exiled, or in any manner destroyed, but by the lawful judgment
of his peers or by the law of the land.</p>

<p>And in the eight and twentieth year of the reign of King
Edward III., it was declared and enacted by the authority
of Parliament that no man of what estate or condition that
he be, should be put out of his lands or tenements, nor taken,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
nor imprisoned, nor disherited, nor put to death, without
being brought to answer by the process of law.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, against the tenour of the said statutes, and
other the good laws and statutes of your realm, to that end
provided, divers of your subjects have of late been imprisoned
without any cause shewed. And when for their
deliverance they were brought before your justices, by your
Majesty's writs of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Habeas Corpus</i>, there to undergo and
receive as the court should order, and their keepers commanded
to certify the cause of their detainer, no cause was
certified, but that they were detained by your Majesty's
special command, signified by the lords of your privy council,
and yet were returned back to several prisons, without being
charged with anything to which they might make answer
according to law.</p>

<p>And whereas of late great companies of soldiers and
mariners have been dispersed into divers counties of the
realm; and the inhabitants, against their wills, have been
compelled to receive them into their houses, and there to
suffer them to sojourn against the laws and customs of this
realm, and to the great grievance and vexation of the people.</p>

<p>And whereas also, by authority of Parliament in the 25th
year of Edward III. it is declared and enacted, that no man
should be forejudged of life or limb against the form of Magna
Charta, and the law of the land, and by the said great Charter
and other the laws and statutes of this your realm, no man ought
to be adjudged to death, but by the laws established in this
realm, either by the customs of the said realm, or by acts of
parliament. And whereas no offender of what kind soever
is exempted from the proceedings to be used, or punishments
to be inflicted by the laws and statutes of this your realm:
Nevertheless divers commissioners under your Majesty's great
seal have issued forth, by which certain persons have been
assigned and appointed commissioners, with power and
authority to proceed within the land, according to the justice
of martial law, against such soldiers or mariners, or other
dissolute persons joining with them, as should commit any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
murder, robbery, felony, mutiny, or other outrage or misdemeanour
whatsoever, and by such summary course and
order, as is agreeable to martial law, and as is used in armies in
time of war, to proceed to the trial and condemnation of such
offenders, and them to cause to be executed and put to death
according to the law martial.</p>

<p>By pretext whereof, some of your Majesty's subjects have
been by the said commissioners put to death, when and
where, if by the laws and statutes of the realm they had
deserved death, by the same <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'laws and statues'">laws and statutes</ins> also they
might, and by no other ought to have been judged and
executed.</p>

<p>And also sundry grievous offenders, by colour thereof
claiming an exemption, have escaped the punishments due
to them by the laws and statutes of this your realm, by reason
that divers of your officers and ministers of justice have
unjustly refused or forborne to proceed against such offenders,
according to the same law and statutes, upon pretence that
the said offenders were punishable only by martial law, and
by authority of such commissioners as aforesaid. Which
commissioners and all other of like nature are wholly and
directly contrary to the said laws and statutes of this your
realm.</p>

<p>They do therefore humbly pray your most excellent Majesty,
that no man hereafter be compelled to make or yield any gift,
or loan, benevolence, tax, or such like charge, without common
consent by act of parliament. And that none be called to
make answer, or to take such oath, or to give attendance, or
be confined, or otherwise molested or disquieted, concerning
the same or for refusal thereof. And that no freeman, in any
such manner as is before mentioned, be imprisoned or detained.
And that your majesty would be pleased to remove
the said soldiers and mariners, and that your people may not
be so burdened in time to come. And that the foresaid commissioners
for proceeding by martial law may be revoked and
annulled. And that hereafter no commissions of like nature
may issue forth to any person or persons whatsoever, to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
executed as aforesaid, lest by colour of them any of your
Majesty's subjects be destroyed or put to death, contrary to
the laws and franchise of the land....</p>

<p>So the fine was settled to £2,000 and all (except the two
Chief Justices) concurred for a submission to be made. And
accordingly a copy of the submission was sent to the Warden
of the Fleet, to show the said Richard Chambers.</p>

<p>"I, Richard Chambers of London, Merchant, do humbly
acknowledge that, whereas upon an information exhibited
against me by the King's Attorney General, I was in Easter
Term last sentenced by the Honourable Court of Star
Chamber, for that in September last, 1628, being convented
before the Lords and others of his Majestie's most honourable
Privy Council Board, upon some speeches then used concerning
the merchants of this kingdom, and his Majesty's well and
gracious usage of them, did then and there, in insolent contemptuous
and seditious manner, falsely and maliciously say
and affirm 'That they,' meaning the merchants, 'are in no
parts of the world so screwed and wrung as in England, and
that in Turkey they have more encouragement....' Now
I, the said Richard Chambers in obedience to the sentence of
the said honourable court, do humbly confess and acknowledge
the speaking of these words aforesaid and am heartily
sorry for the same: and do humbly beseech your Lordships
all to be honourable intercessors for me to his Majesty, that he
would be graciously pleased to pardon this great error and
fault so committed by me."</p>

<p>When Mr. Chambers read this draft of submission, he thus

<p>It is a greate parte of our royal care, like as it was of our
royal Father of blessed memory deceased, to maintain and
increase the trade of our marchants, and the strength of our
Navy, as principal veins and sinews for the wealth and
strength of our kingdom;</p>

<p>Whereas therefore the Society and Company of our Eastland
Marchaunts trading the Baltic Seas, have by the space
of Fifty years at the least, had a settled and constant possession
of Trade in those parts, and have had both the sole
carrying thither of our English commodities, and also the
sole bringing in of all the Commodities of those Countries, as
namely, hemp, yarn, cable yarn, flax, potashes, soapashes,
polonia wool, cordage, eastland linen cloth, pitch, tar,
and wood, whereby our Kingdom hath been much enriched,
our ships and mariners set on work, and the honour and
fame of our nation and kingdom spread and enlarged in
those parts.</p>

<p>And whereas for their further encouragement the said

Great Seal of England in the time of the late Queen Elizabeth,
privileges, as well for the sole carrying out to those countries
of all our English commodities, as also for the sole bringing
in of the abovenamed commodities of the said countries, with
general prohibitions and restraints of others not licensed and
authorized, by the said Letters Patents to traffick or trade
contrary to the tenor of the same Letters Patents: We
minding the upholding and continuance of the said trade,
and not to suffer that the said Society shall sustain any
violation or diminution of their liberties and privileges, Have
thought good to ratify and publish unto all persons, as well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
subjects as strangers, the said privileges and restraints, to
the end that none of them presume to attempt any thing
against the same;</p>

<p>And We do hereby straitly charge and command all our
customers, comptrollers, and all other our officers at the
ports, and also the farmers of our customes, and their
Deputies and Wayters, that they suffer not any broadcloath,
dozens, kersies, bayes, skins, or such like English commodities
to be shipped for exportation to those parts, nor any hemp,

<p>Lastly: though you are apt to think yourselves such
necessary instruments for all good purposes, and that nothing
can be well done unless you do it; that no unity or constancy
in religion can be maintained, but inevitably Christendom
must fall to ruin and confusion, unless you support it; yet
we that are indifferent and impartial, and well content that
God should give us his own favours, by means of his own
appointment, not of our choosing, can easily collect out of
these very words, that not the infallibility of your or of any
Church, but the <em>apostles and prophets, and evangelists, &amp;c.,
which Christ gave upon his ascension</em>, were designed by him,
for the compassing all these excellent purposes, by their
preaching while they lived, and by their writings for ever.
And if they fail hereof, the reason is not any insufficiency or
invalidity in the means, but the voluntary perverseness of the
subjects they have to deal with; who, if they would be themselves,
and be content that others should be, in the choice
of their religion, the servants of God and not of men; if they
would allow, that the way to heaven is no narrower now than
Christ left it, his yoke no heavier than he made it; that the
belief of no more difficulties is required now to salvation, than
was in the primitive church; that no error is in itself destructive,
and exclusive from salvation now, which was not then;
if, instead of being zealous Papists, earnest Calvinists, rigid
Lutherans, they would become themselves, and be content
that others should be, plain and honest Christians; if all men
would believe the Scripture, and, freeing themselves from
prejudice and passion, would sincerely endeavour to find the
true sense of it, and live according to it, and require no more
of others but to do so; nor denying their communion to any
that do so, would so order their public service of God, that all
which do so may, without scruple or hypocrisy, or protesta<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>tion
against any part of it, join with them in it;&mdash;who doth
not see that seeing (as we suppose here, and shall prove hereafter)
all necessary truths are plainly and evidently set down
in Scripture, there would of necessity be among all men, in all
things necessary, unity of opinion? And, notwithstanding any
other differences that are or could be, unity of communion
and charity and mutual toleration? By which means, all
schism and heresy would be banished the world; and those
wretched contentions which now rend and tear in pieces, not
the coat, but the members and bowels, of Christ, which mutual
pride, and tyranny, and cursing, and killing, and damning,
would fain make immortal, should speedily receive a most
blessed catastrophe.</p>

<p class="pfs90"><b>Source.</b>&mdash;Clarendon, <cite>History of Rebellion</cite>. Book I., § 159.</p>


<p>Now, I must be so just as to say, that, during the whole
time that these pressures were exercised, and these new and
extraordinary ways were run, that is from the dissolution of
the Parliament in the fourth year (1629) to the beginning of
this Parliament which was above 12 years, this kingdom and
all his majesty's dominions (of the interruption in Scotland
somewhat shall be said in its due time and place), enjoyed the
greatest calm, and the fullest measure of felicity, that any
people in any age, for so long time together, have been blessed
with; to the wonder and envy of all the parts of Christendom.</p>

<p>And in this comparison I am neither unmindful of, nor ungrateful
for the happy times of Queen Elisabeth, nor for those
more happy under King James. But for the former, the
doubts, hazards, and perplexities, upon a total change and
alteration of religion, and some confident attempts upon a
further alteration by those who thought not the reformation
enough; the charge, trouble, and anxiety of a long continued
war (how prosperous and successful soever) even during that
Queen's whole reign; and (besides some domestic ruptures
into rebellion, frequently into treason, and besides the blemish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
of an unparalleled act of blood upon the life of a crowned
neighbour, queen and ally) the fear and apprehension of
what was to come (which is one of the most unpleasant kinds
of melancholy) from an unknown, at least an unacknowledged
successor to the crown, clouded much of that prosperity then
which now shines with so much splendour before our eyes in
chronicle.</p>

<p>And for the other under King James (which indeed were
excellent times <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bona si sua norint</i>), the mingling with a stranger
nation, (formerly not very gracious with this,) which was like
to have more interest of favour: the subjection to a stranger
prince, whose nature and disposition they knew not; the noise
of treason, (the most prodigious that had ever been attempted),
upon his first entrance into the kingdom: the wants of the
Crown not inferior to what it hath since felt, (I mean whilst
it sat right on the head of the King,) and the pressures upon
the subject of the same nature, and no less complained of:
the absence of the prince in Spain, and the solicitude that his
highness might not be disposed in marriage to the daughter
of that kingdom; rendered the calm and tranquillity of that
time less equal and pleasant. To which may be added the
prosperity and happiness of the neighbour kingdoms, not much
inferior to that of this, which, according to the pulse of states,
is a great diminution of their health; at least their prosperity
is much improved, and more visible, by the misery and misfortunes
of their neighbours.</p>

<p>The happiness of the times I mentioned was enviously set
off by this, that every other kingdom, every other province were
engaged, many entangled, and some almost destroyed by the
rage and fury of arms; those which were ambitiously in contention
with their neighbours having the view and apprehensions
of the miseries and desolation, which they saw
other states suffer by a civil war; whilst the kingdoms we
now lament were alone looked upon as the garden of the
world; Scotland (which was but the wilderness of that garden)
in a full, entire, undisturbed peace, which they had never
seen, the rage and barbarism (that is, the blood, for of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
charity we speak not) of their private feuds, being composed
to the reverence or to the awe of public justice; in a competency,
if not in an excess of plenty, which they had never
hoped to see, and in a temper (which was the utmost we
desired and hoped to see) free from rebellion; Ireland, which
had been a sponge to draw and a gulf to swallow all that could
be spared, and all that could be got from England, merely
to keep the reputation of a kingdom, reduced to that good
degree of husbandry and government, that it not only subsisted
of itself, and gave this kingdom all that it might have
expected from it; but really increased the revenue of the
crown forty or fifty thousand pounds a year, besides much
more to the people in the traffic and trade from thence; arts
and sciences fruitfully planted there; and the whole nation
beginning to be so civilized, that it was a jewel of great lustre
in the royal diadem.</p>

<p>When these outworks were thus fortified and adorned, it
was no wonder if England was generally thought secure, with
the advantages of its own climate; the court in great plenty,
or rather (which is the discredit of plenty) excess, and luxury;
the country rich, and, which is more, fully enjoying the pleasure
of its own wealth, and so the easier corrupted with the pride
and wantonness of it; the Church flourishing with learned
and extraordinary men, and (which other good times wanted)
supplied with oil to feed those lamps, and the protestant
religion more advanced against the Church of Rome by
writing especially (without prejudice to other useful and godly
labours) by those two books of the late lord archbishop of
Canterbury his grace, and of Mr. Chillingworth, than it had
been from the Reformation; trade increased to that degree,
that we were the exchange of Christendom, (the revenue
thereof to the crown being almost double to what it had been
in the best times), and the bullion of all other kingdoms
brought to receive a stamp from the mint of England; all
foreign merchants looking upon nothing as their own, but
what they had laid up in the warehouses of this kingdom; the
royal navy, in number and equipage much above former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
times, very formidable at sea; and the reputation of the greatness
and power of the King much more with foreign princes
than any of his progenitors; for those rough courses, which
made him haply less loved at home, made him more feared
abroad; by how much the power of kingdoms is more reverenced
than their justice by their neighbours: and it may be,
this consideration might not be the least motive, and may not
be the worst excuse, for those councils. Lastly, for a complement
of all these blessings, they were enjoyed by and under
the protection of a king, of the most harmless disposition
and the most exemplary piety, the greatest example of sobriety,
chastity, and mercy, that any prince hath been endued
with, (and God forgive those that have not been sensible of
and thankful for those endowments) and who might have
said, that which Pericles was proud of, upon his deathbed,
"that no Englishman had ever worn a black gown through
his occasion." In a word, many wise men thought it a
time, wherein those two adjuncts, which Nerva was deified
for uniting, were as well reconciled as is possible.</p>

<p>But all these blessings could but enable, not compel us to
be happy: we wanted that sense, acknowledgement, and value
of our own happiness, which all but we had; and took pains
to make, when we could not find, ourselves miserable. There
was in truth a strange absence of understanding in most, and
a strange perverseness of understanding in the rest: the court
full of excess, idleness, and luxury; and the country full of
pride, mutiny and discontent; every man more troubled and
perplexed at that they called the violation of one law, than
delighted or pleased with the observance of all the rest of
the Charter; never imputing the increase of their receipts,
revenue, and plenty, to the wisdom, virtue and merit of the
Crown, but objecting every little trivial imposition to the
exorbitancy and tyranny of the government; the growth of
knowledge and learning being disrelished for the infirmities
of some learned men, and the increase of grace and favour
upon the Church, more repined and murmured at, than the
increase of piety and devotion in the Church, which was as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
visible, acknowledged or taken notice of; whilst the indiscretion
and folly of one sermon at Whitehall was more bruited
abroad and commented upon than the wisdom, sobriety and
devotion of a hundred.</p>

<p>Chiefly beware of divisions in your counsels. For division
confines always upon ruin, leads ever to some fatal precipice
or other. Divide not between Protestant and Papist, for
this meeting is merely civil, religion not at all concerned one
way or another. In this I have endeavoured to give you
satisfaction both privately and publicly, and now I assure you
again there is nothing of religion to be stirred in this Parliament,
being only assembled to settle the temporal state, which
you may now safely confide upon. For, believe me, I have
a more hallowed regard to my master's honour, than to profane
his chair with untruths, so as if, after all this, any shall
again spring this doubt amongst you, it is not to be judged
to arise from hardness of belief, but much rather from a
perverse and malevolent spirit, desirous to embroil your peaceable
proceedings with party and faction. And I trust your
wisdom and temper will quickly conjure all such forth from
amongst you.</p>

<p>Divide not nationally, betwixt English and Irish. The
King makes no distinction between you, reputes you all
without prejudice, and that upon safe and sure grounds, I
assure myself, his good and faithful subjects. And madness
it were in you then to raise that wall of separation amongst
yourselves. If you should, you know who the old proverb
deems likest to go to the wall, and believe me England will
not prove the weakest.</p>

<p>But above all, divide not between the interests of the king<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
and his people as if there were one being of the king and
another being of his people. This is the most mischievous
principle that can be laid in reason of state, in that which, if
you watch not very well, may the easiest mislead you. For
you might as well tell me a head might live without a body,
or a body without a head, as that it is possible for a king to
be rich and happy without his people be so likewise, or that
a people can be rich and happy without the king be so also.
Most certain it is, that their well-being is individually one
and the same, their interests woven up together with so
tender and close threads, as cannot be pulled asunder without
a rent in the commonwealth.</p>

<p>It may seem strange that this people should be so obstinately
set against their own good, and yet the reason is plain; for
the Friars and Jesuits fearing that these laws would conform
them here to the manners of England, and in time be a means to
lead them on to a conformity in religion and faith also, they
catholicly oppose and fence up every path leading to so good
a purpose. And indeed I see plainly that so long as this
kingdom continues popish, they are not a people for the
crown of England to be confident of. Whereas if they were
not still distempered by the infusion of these Friars and
Jesuits, I am of belief, they would be as good and loyal to
their King as any other subjects.</p>

<p class="pfs90"><em>Wentworth to Sir Christopher Wandesford, July 25, 1636.</em>
Knowler, vol. ii., p. 19.</p>

<p class="pfs100">[A summary of his report to the King.]</p>

<p>... [I informed them] that there was little or no manufacture
amongst them, but some small beginnings towards a clothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
trade, which I had and so should still discourage all I could,
unless otherwise directed by his Majesty and their Lordships,
in regard it would trench not only upon the clothing of
England, being our staple commodity, so as if they should
manufacture their own wools, which grew to very great
quantities, we should not only lose the profit we now made
by indraping their wools, but his Majesty lose extremely by
his customs, and in conclusion it might be feared, they would
beat us out of the Trade itself, by underselling us, which they
were well able to do. Besides, in reason of State, so long
as they did not indrape their own wools, they must of
necessity fetch their clothing from us, and consequently
in a sort depend upon us for their livelihood, and thereby
become so dependent upon this crown, as they could not
depart from us without nakedness to themselves and
children.</p>

<p>Yet have I endeavoured another way to set them on work,
and that is by bringing in the making and trade of linen cloth,
the rather in regard the women are all naturally bred to spinning,
that the Irish earth is apt for bearing of flax, and that
this manufacture would be in the conclusion rather a benefit
than other to this kingdom. I have therefore sent for the
flax seed into Holland, being of a better sort than we have
any; and sown this year a thousand pounds worth of it
(finding by some I sowed the last year that it takes there very
well). I have sent for workmen out of the Low Countries,
and forth of France, and set up already six or seven looms,
which if it please God to bless us this year, I trust so to
invite them to follow it, when they see the great profit arising
thereby, as that they shall generally take to it and employ
themselves that way, which if they do, I am confident it will
prove a mighty business, considering that in all probability
we shall be able to undersell the linen cloths of Holland and
France at least twenty in the hundred.</p>

<p class="pfs90"><em>To Laud, Aug. 17, 1636, from Gawthorp.</em> Knowler, vol. ii.,
p. 26.</p>

<p>I am gotten hither to a poor house I have, having been this
last week almost feasted to death at York. In truth for
anything I can find they were not ill-pleased to see me. Sure
I am it much contented me to be amongst my old acquaintance,
which I would not leave for any other affection I have,
but to that which I both profess and owe to the person of
his sacred majesty. Lord! with what quietness in myself
could I live here, in comparison of that noise and labour I
meet with elsewhere; and, I protest, put up more crowns in
my purse at the year's end too. But we'll let that pass.
For I am not like to enjoy that blessed condition upon earth.
And therefore my resolution is set to endure and struggle
with it so long as this crazy body will bear it; and finally drop
into the silent grave, where both all these (which I now could,
as I think, innocently delight myself in) and myself are to be
forgotten: and fare them well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My very good Lord</span>,<br />

<span class="pad3">I</span> heartily thank your Lordship for all your love, and
for the joy you are pleased both to conceive and express for
my translation to Canterbury; for I conceive all your expressions
to me are very hearty, and such I have hitherto
found them. And now, since I am there, (for my translation
is to be on Thursday, Sept. 19th,) I must desire your Lordship
not to expect more at my hands than I shall be able to perform,
either in Church or State; and this suit of mine hath a
great deal of reason in it; for you write, that ordinary things
are far beneath that which you cannot choose but promise
yourself of me in both respects. But, my Lord, to speak
freely, you may easily promise more in either kind than I
can perform. For, as for the Church, it is so bound up in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
forms of the common law, that it is not possible for me, or
for any man, to do that good which he would, or is bound to
do. For your Lordship sees, no man clearer, that they which
have gotten so much power in and over the Church, will not
let go their hold; they have, indeed, fangs with a witness,
whatsoever I was once said in passion to have. And for the
State, indeed, my Lord, I am for <em>Thorough</em>, but I see that
both thick and thin stays somebody, where I conceive it
should not; and it is impossible for me to go through alone.
Besides, private ends are such blocks in the public way, and
lie so thick, that you may promise what you will, and I must
perform what I can, and no more.</p>

<p>Next, my Lord, I thank you heartily for your kind wishes
to me, that God would send me many and happy days where
I now am to be. Amen. I can do little for myself, if I
cannot say so; but truly, my Lord, I look for neither: not
for many, for I am in years, and have had a troublesome life;
not for happy, because I have no hope to do the good I desire;
and, besides, I doubt I shall never be able to hold my health
there one year; for instead of all the jolting which I had over
the stones between London House and Whitehall, which was
almost daily, I shall have now no exercise, but slide over in a
barge to the Court and Star Chamber; and in truth, my Lord,
I speak seriously, I have had a heaviness hang upon me ever
since I was nominated to this place, and I can give myself
no account of it, unless it proceed from an apprehension that
there is more expected from me than the craziness of these
times will give me leave to do.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now, my Lord, why may you not write, as whilom you did
to the Bishop of London? The man is the same, and the same
to you; but I see you stay for better acquaintance, and till
then you will keep distance. I perceive, also, my predecessor's
awe is upon you, but I doubt I shall never hold it
long; and I was about to swear by my troth, as you do, but
I remember oaths heretofore were wont to pass under the
Privy Seal, and not the Ordinary Seal of letters. Well, wiser
or not, you must take that as you find it; but I will not write<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
any long letters and leave out my mirth, it is one of the
recreations I have always used with my friends, and 'tis
hard leaving an old custom, neither do I purpose to do it;
though I mean to make choice of my friends, to whom I
will use it. For proof of this, I here send your Lordship
some sermon notes which I have received from Cambridge;
and, certainly, if this be your method there, you ride as much
aside as ever Croxton did towards Ireland. I wish your Lordship
all health and happiness, and so leave you to the grace
of God, ever resting</p>

impeached Thomas Earl of Strafford of high treason, for
endeavouring to subvert the ancient and fundamental laws

and to introduce an arbitrary and tyrannical government
against law in the said kingdoms; and for exercising a
tyrannous and exorbitant power over and against the laws
of the said kingdoms, over the liberties, estates and lives of
his majesty's subjects; and likewise for having, by his own
authority, commanded the laying and assessing of soldiers
upon his Majesty's subjects in Ireland against their consents,
to compel them to obey his unlawful commands and orders,
made upon paper petitions, in causes between party and
party, which accordingly was executed upon divers of his
Majesty's subjects in a warlike manner within the said realm
of Ireland, and in so doing did levy war against the King's
majesty and his liege people in that kingdom; and also for
that he, upon the unhappy dissolution of the last Parliament,
did slander the House of Commons to his Majesty and did
counsel and advise his Majesty that he was loose and absolved
from rules of government, and that he had an army in Ireland
which he might employ to reduce this kingdom; for which he
deserves to undergo the pains and forfeitures of high treason.</p>

between the two kingdoms of England and Scotland, all which
offences have been sufficiently proved against the said Earl

<p class="pfs90"><b>Source.</b>&mdash;Rushworth. Vol. iii., p. 251.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">May it please Your Sacred Majesty</span>,<br />

<span class="pad3">It</span> hath been my greatest grief, in all these troubles,
to be taken as a person which should endeavour to represent
and set things amiss between your Majesty and your people;
and to give counsels tending to the disquiet of the three
kingdoms.</p>

<p>Most true it is, that this (mine own private condition considered,)
had been a great madness; since, through your
gracious favour I was so provided, as not to expect, in any
kind, to mind my fortune or please my mind more, than by
resting where your bounteous hands had placed me.</p>

<p>Nay, it is most mightily mistaken. For unto your majesty
it is well known, my poor and humble advice concluded still
in this, that your majesty and your people could never be
happy till there was a right understanding betwixt you and
them; and that no other means were left to effect and settle
this happiness but by the counsel and assent of your parliament;
or to prevent the growing evils of this state, but by
entirely putting yourself in this last resort upon the loyalty and
good affections of your English subjects.</p>

<p>Yet, such is my misfortune, that this truth findeth little
credit; yea, the contrary seemeth generally to be believed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
and myself reputed as one who endeavoured to make a
separation between you and your people. Under a heavier
censure than this, I am persuaded, no gentleman can suffer.</p>

<p>Now I understand the minds of men are more and more
incensed against me, notwithstanding your Majesty hath
declared that in your princely opinion, I am not guilty of
treason; nor are you satisfied in your conscience to pass
the bill.</p>

<p>This bringeth me in a very great strait: there is before
me the ruin of my children and family, hitherto untouched,
in all the branches of it, with any foul crime: here are before
me the many ills which may befall your sacred person, and
the whole kingdom, should yourself and the parliament part
less satisfied one with the other than is necessary for the preservation
both of king and people: here are before me the
things most valued, most feared by mortal men, life and
death.</p>

<p>To say, Sir, that there hath not been a strife in me, were
to make me less man than (God knoweth) my infirmities
make me. And to call a destruction upon myself and young
children, where the intentions of my heart, at least, have
been innocent of this great offence, may be believed will find
no easy consent from flesh and blood.</p>

<p>But, with much sadness, I am come to a resolution of
that, which I take to be the best becoming me; and to look
upon it as that which is most principal in itself, which,
doubtless, is the prosperity of your sacred person, and the
commonwealth, things infinitely before any private man's
interest.</p>

<p>And therefore, in few words, as I put myself wholly upon
the honour and justice of my peers, so clearly, as to wish
your majesty might please to have spared that declaration of
yours on Saturday last, and entirely to have left me to their
lordships; so now, to set your majesty's conscience at
liberty, I do most humbly beseech your majesty, for the
prevention of evils which may happen by your refusal, to
pass this bill, and by this means to remove, (praised be God,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
I cannot say this accursed, but I confess) this unfortunate
thing forth of the way; towards that blessed agreement,
which God, I trust, shall ever establish between you and
your subjects.</p>

<p>Sir, my consent shall more acquit you herein to God, than
all the world can do besides. To a willing man there is no
injury done: and as, by God's grace, I forgive all the world
with calmness and meekness of infinite contentment to my
dislodging soul: so, Sir, to you I can give the life of this
world with all the cheerfulness imaginable, in the just
acknowledgement of your exceeding favours; and only beg
that, in your goodness, you would vouchsafe to cast your
gracious regard upon my poor son and his sisters, less or
more, and no otherwise than their (in present) unfortunate
father may hereafter appear more or less guilty of his death.
God long preserve your majesty.</p>

<p>We having received from you, soon after our return out
of Scotland, a long petition consisting of many desires of
great moment, together with a declaration of a very unusual
nature annexed thereunto, we had taken some time to consider
of it, as befitted us in a matter of that consequence,
being confident that your own reason and regard to us, as
well as our express intimation by our comptroller, to that
purpose, would have restrained you from the publishing of
it till such time as you should have received our answer to it;
but, much against our expectation, finding the contrary, that
the said declaration is already abroad in print, by directions
from your House as appears by the printed copy, we must let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
you know that we are very sensible of the disrespect. Notwithstanding,
it is our intention that no failing on your part
shall make us fail in ours, of giving all due satisfaction to the
desires of our people in a parliamentary way; and therefore
we send you this answer to your petition, reserving ourself
in point of the declaration which we think unparliamentary,
and shall take a course to do that which we shall think fit in
prudence and honour.</p>

<p>To the petition, we say that although there are divers
things in the preamble of it which we are so far from admitting
that we profess we cannot at all understand them, as of "a
wicked and malignant party prevalent in the government";
of "some of that party admitted to our Privy Council and
to other employments of trust, and nearest to us and our
children"; of "endeavours to sow among the people false
scandals and imputations, to blemish and disgrace the proceedings
of the Parliament"; all, or any of them, did we know
of, we should be as ready to remedy and punish as you to
complain of, so that the prayers of your petition are grounded
upon such premises as we must in no wise admit; yet, notwithstanding,
we are pleased to give this answer to you.</p>

<p>To the first, concerning religion, consisting of several
branches, we say that, for preserving the peace and safety of
this kingdom from the design of the Popish party, we have,
and will still, concur with all the just desires of our people in
a parliamentary way: that, for the depriving of the Bishops
of their votes in Parliament, we should have you consider
that their right is grounded upon the fundamental law of
the kingdom and constitution of Parliament. This we would
have you consider; but since you desire our concurrence
herein in a parliamentary way, we will give no further answer
at this time.</p>

<p>As for the abridging of the inordinate power of the clergy,
we conceive that the taking away of the High Commission
Court hath well moderated that; but if there continue any
usurpations or excesses in their jurisdictions, we therein
neither have nor will protect them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>Unto that clause which concerneth corruptions (as you style
them) in religion, in Church government, and in discipline,
and the removing of such unnecessary ceremonies as weak
consciences might check at: that for any illegal innovations
which may have crept in, we shall willingly concur in the
removal of them: that, if our Parliament shall advise us to
call a national synod, which may duly examine such ceremonies
as give just cause of offence to any, we shall take it
into consideration, and apply ourself to give due satisfaction
therein; but we are very sorry to hear, in such general terms,
corruption in religion objected, since we are persuaded in our
consciences that no Church can be found upon the earth that
professeth the true religion with more purity of doctrine than
the Church of England doth, nor where the government and
discipline are jointly more beautified and free from superstition,
than as they are here established by law, which, by
the grace of God, we will with constancy maintain (while we
live) in their purity and glory, not only against all invasions
of Popery, but also from the irreverence of those many
schismatics and separatists, wherewith of late this kingdom
and this city abounds, to the great dishonour and hazard
both of Church and State, for the suppression of whom we
require your timely aid and active assistance.</p>

<p>To the second prayer of the petition, the removal and
choice of councillors, we know not any of our Council to whom
the character set forth in the petition can belong: that by those
whom we had exposed to trial, we have already given you
sufficient testimony that there is no man so near unto us in
place or affection, whom we will not leave to the justice of
the law, if you shall bring a particular charge and sufficient
proofs against him; and of this we do again assure you, but
in the meantime we wish you to forbear such general aspersions
as may reflect upon all our Council, since you name none in
particular.</p>

<p>That for the choice of our councillors and ministers of state,
it were to debar us that natural liberty all freemen have; and
as it is the undoubted right of the Crown of England to call<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
such persons to our secret counsels, to public employment and
our particular service as we shall think fit, so we are, and
ever shall be, very careful to make election of such persons
in those places of trust as shall have given good testimonies
of their abilities and integrity, and against whom there can
be no just cause of exception whereon reasonably to ground
a diffidence; and to choices of this nature, we assure you
that the mediation of the nearest unto us hath always
concurred.</p>

<p>To the third prayer of your petition concerning Ireland,
we understand your desire of not alienating the forfeited
lands thereof, to proceed from much care and love, and likewise
that it may be a resolution very fit for us to take; but
whether it be seasonable to declare resolutions of that nature
before the events of a war be seen, that we much doubt of.
Howsoever, we cannot but thank you for this care, and your
cheerful engagement for the suppression of that rebellion;
upon the speedy effecting whereof, the glory of God in the
protestant profession, the safety of the British there, our
honour, and that of the nation, so much depends; all the
interests of this kingdom being so involved in that business,
we cannot but quicken your affections therein, and shall
desire you to frame your counsels, to give such expedition to
the work as the nature thereof and the pressures in point of
time require; and whereof you are put in mind by the daily
insolence and increase of those rebels.</p>

<p>For conclusion, your promise to apply yourselves to such
courses as may support our royal estate with honour and
plenty at home, and with power and reputation abroad, is
that which we have ever promised ourself, both from your
loyalties and affections, and also for what we have already
done, and shall daily go adding unto, for the comfort and
happiness of our people.</p>

<p>When puritanism grew into a faction, the zealots distinguished
themselves, both men and women, by several affectations
of habit, looks, and words, which, had it been a real
forsaking of vanity, and an embracing of sobriety in all those
things, would have been most commendable; but their quick
forsaking of those things, when they had arrived at their
object, showed that they either never took them up for conscience,
or were corrupted by their prosperity to take up
those vain things they durst not practise under persecution.
Among other affected habits, few of the puritans, what degree
soever they were of, wore their hair long enough to cover
their ears, and the ministers and many others cut it close
round their heads, with so many little peaks, as was something
ridiculous to behold; whereupon Cleaveland, in his Hue and
Cry after them, begins,</p>

<p class="pad4 fs90">
"With hayre in Characters and Luggs in Text," etc.</p>

<p class="noindent">From this custom of wearing their hair, that name of roundhead
became the scornful term given to the whole parliament
party, whose army indeed marched out as if they had been
only sent out till their hair was grown. Two or three years
after, any stranger that had seen them, would have inquired
the reason of that name. It was very ill applied to Mr.
Hutchinson, who, having naturally a very fine thickset head
of hair, kept it clean and handsome, so that it was a great
ornament to him; although the godly of those days, when he
embraced their party, would not allow him to be religious
because his hair was not in their cut, nor his words in their
phrase, nor such little formalities altogether fitted to their
humour; who were, many of them, so weak as to esteem such
insignificant circumstances, rather than solid wisdom, piety,
and courage, which brought real aid and honour to their
party. But as Mr. Hutchinson chose not them, but the God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
they served, and the truth and righteousness they defended,
so did not their weaknesses, censures, ingratitude, or discouraging
behaviour, with which he was abundantly exercised
all his life, make him forsake them in any thing wherein they
adhered to just and honourable principles or practices; but
when they apostatized from these, none cast them off with
greater indignation, how shining soever the profession was
that gilt, not a temple of living grace, but a tomb, which
only held the carcase of religion.</p>

<p>Whereas the distressed estate of Ireland, steeped in her
own blood, and the distracted estate of England, threatened
with a cloud of blood by the civil war, call for all possible
means to appease and avert the Wrath of God, appearing in
these judgments; among which Fasting and Prayer, having
been often tried to be very effectual, having been lately
and are still enjoined; and whereas public sports do not
well agree with public calamities, nor public stage plays with
the seasons of humiliation, this being an exercise of sad and
pious solemnity, and the other being spectacles of pleasure,
too commonly expressing lascivious mirth and levity: it is
therefore thought fit and ordained, by the Lords and Commons
in this parliament assembled, that while these sad causes
and set times of humiliation do continue, public Stage Plays
shall cease and be forborn, instead of which are recommended
to the people of this land, the profitable and seasonable
considerations of repentance, reconciliation and peace with
God, which probably may produce outward peace and prosperity,
and bring again times of joy and gladness to these
nations.</p>

<p class="pfs90"><b>Source.</b>&mdash;<cite>The Holy State</cite>, by Thomas Fuller, 1642. P. 116.</p>


<p>Is a gentleman in ore whom the next age may see refined,
and is the wax capable of a gentle impression, when the prince
shall stamp it. Wise Solon (who accounted Tellus the
Athenian the most happy man for living privately on his own
lands) would surely have pronounced the English yeomanry
a fortunate condition, living in the temperate zone betwixt
greatness and want, an estate of people almost peculiar to
England. France and Italy are like a die which hath no
points betwixt six and ace, Nobility and Peasantry. Their
walls though high must needs be hollow, wanting filling stones.
Indeed Germany hath her Boors like our Yeomen, but by a
tyrannical appropriation of Nobility to some few ancient
families, their yeomen are excluded from ever rising higher
to clarify their bloods. In England the Temple of Honour is
bolted against none who have passed through the Temple of
Virtue, nor is a capacity to be gentle denied to our Yeoman,
who thus behaves himself.</p>

<p>He wears Russet clothes but makes golden payment, having
tin in his buttons and silver in his pockets. If he chance
to appear in clothes above his rank, it is to grace some great
man with his service, and then he blusheth at his own bravery.
Otherwise he is the surest landmark where foreigners may
take aim of the ancient English customs; the Gentry more
shooting after foreign fashions.</p>

<p>In his house he is bountiful both to strangers and poor
people. Some hold when hospitality died in England, she
gave her last groan amongst the yeomen of Kent. And still
at our yeoman's table you shall have as many joints as
dishes. No meat disguised with strange sauces, no straggling
joint of a sheep in the midst of a pasture of grass, beset with
salads on every side, but solid substantial food, no servitors,
(more nimble with their hands than the guests with their teeth)
take away meat before stomachs [appetites] are taken away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
Here you have that which in itself is good, made better by
the store of it and best by the welcome to it.</p>

<p>He hath a great stroke in making a knight of the shire.
Good reason, for he makes a whole line in the subsidy book,
where whatsoever he is rated, he pays without any regret,
not caring how much his purse is let blood, so it be done by
the advice of the physicians of the State. He seldom goes
far abroad, and his credit stretcheth farther than his travel.
He goes not to London, but <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">se defendo</i> to save himself of a
fine being returned of a Jury, where seeing the King once, he
prays for him ever afterwards.</p>

<p>In his own country he is a main man in Juries. Where if
the judge please to open his eyes in matter of Law, he needs
not to be led by the nose in matters of fact. He is very
observant of the Judges <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">item</i>, where it followeth the truth
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in primis</i>; otherwise (though not mutinous in a Jury) he
cares not whom he displeaseth, so he pleaseth his own conscience.
He improveth his land to a double value by his
good husbandry. Some grounds that wept with water, or
frowned with thorns, by draining the one and clearing the
other, he makes both to laugh and sing with corn. By marl
and limestones burnt he bettereth his ground, and his industry
worketh miracles by turning stones into bread....</p>

<p>In time of famine he is the Joseph of the country, and keeps
the poor from starving. Then he tameth his stacks of corn,
which not his covetousness, but providence hath reserved for
time of need, and to his poor neighbours abateth somewhat
of the high price of the market. The neighbour gentry court
him for his acquaintance, which he either modestly waiveth,
or thankfully accepteth, but no way greedily desireth. He
insults not the ruins of a decayed gentleman, but pities and
relieves him; and as he is called Goodman, he desires to answer
to the name and to be so indeed.</p>

<p>In war, though he serveth on foot, he is ever mounted on
a high spirit; as being a slave to none and subject only to his
own prince. Innocence and independence make a brave spirit,
whereas otherwise one must ask his leave to be valiant, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
whom he depends. Therefore if a state run up all to noblemen
and gentlemen, so that the husbandmen be only mere
labourers or cottagers (which one [Bacon] called but housed
beggars) it may have good cavalry, but never good bands of
foot so that their armies will be like those birds called Apodes,
without feet, always only flying on their wings of horse.
Wherefore to make good Infantry, it requireth men bred, not
in a senile or indigent fashion, but in some free and plentiful
manner. Wisely therefore did that knowing prince King
Henry VII. provide laws for the increase of his yeomanry,
that his kingdom should not be like to coppice woods, where
the staddles being left too thick all runs to bushes and briars,
and there's little clean underwood. For, enacting that houses
used to husbandry should be kept up with a competent proportion
of land, he did secretly sow Hydra's teeth, whereby
(according to the poet's fiction) should rise up armed men for
the service of this kingdom.</p>

<p class="pfs100"><em>Nehemiah Wharton to George Willingham, Oct. 7, 1642.</em></p>


<p>This day a company of knights, gentlemen, and yeomen of
the county of Hereford came to his Excellency [Essex],
petitioners for strength to be sent speedily to Hereford; and
forthwith we were commanded to draw out fifteen men out
of every company in our regiments, in all about 900, with
three troops of horse and nine pieces of ordnance, with which
we marched, a forlorn hope, towards Hereford.... After
we had marched 10 miles, we came to Bromyard, the weather
wet and the way very foul. Here we got a little refreshment,
and from hence marched 10 miles further to Hereford. But
[it was] very late before we got thither; and by reason of the
rain and snow, and extremity of cold, one of our soldiers died<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
by the way; and it is wonderful we did not all perish, for the
cowardly Cavaliers were within a few miles of us. In this
poor condition coming to Hereford, the gates were shut
against us, and for two hours we stood in dirt and water up
to the mid-leg, for the city were all Malignants, save three
which were Roundheads, and the Marquis of Hereford had
sent them word the day before that they should in no wise
let us in, or if they did, we would plunder their houses, murder
their children, burn their bibles and utterly ruinate all, and
promised he would relieve them himself with all speed, for
which cause the citizens were resolved to oppose us unto the
death, and having in the City three pieces of ordnance, charged
them with stones, nails, etc., and placed them against us,
and we against them, resolving either to enter the city, or die
before it. But the Roundheads in the City, one of them an
alderman surnamed Lane, persuaded the silly Mayor, for so
he is indeed, that his Excellency and all his forces were at
hand, whereupon he opened unto us, and we entered the city
at Byster's gate, but found the doors shut, many of the people
with their children fled, and had enough to do to get a little
quarter. But the poor Mayor, seeing he was so handsomely
cozened, was not a little angry, for Hereford with all his forces,
which fled from Sherborne, promised to visit them the day
following. This night though wet and weary we were fain
to guard the city.... Saturday our squadron watched at
St. Owen's gate, which day I took an opportunity to view the
city, which is well situate, and seated upon the river Wye,
environed with a strong wall better than any I have seen
before, with five gates and a strong stone bridge of six arches,
surpassing Worcester. In this city is the stateliest marketplace
in the Kingdom, built with columns after the manner of
the Exchange: the Minster every way exceeding that at
Worcester; but the city in circuit not so large. The inhabitants
are totally ignorant in the ways of God and much
addicted to drunkenness and other vices, but principally to
swearing, so that the children that have scarce learned to
speak do universally swear stoutly. Many here speak Welsh.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
This day, our companies exercising in the fields at Worcester,
one of the Lord General's soldiers shot at random, and with a
brace of bullets shot one of his fellow-soldiers through the
head, who immediately died. Sabbath day about the time
of morning prayer, we went to the Minster, where the pipes
played and the puppets sang so sweetly that some of our
soldiers could not forbear dancing in the holy choir, whereat
the Baalists were sore displeased. The anthem ended, they
fell to prayer, and prayed devoutly for the King, the Bishops,
etc.; and one of our soldiers with a loud voice said, "What,
never a bit for the Parliament?" which offended them much
more. Not satisfied with this human service, we went to
divine, and passing by found shops open and men at work,
to whom we gave some plain dehortations, and went to hear
Mr. Sedgwick [the Army Chaplain], who gave us two famous
sermons, which much affected the poor inhabitants, who
wondering said they never heard the like before. And I
believe them. The Lord move your hearts to commiserate
their distresses and to send them some faithful and painful
ministers; for the revenue of the college will maintain many
of them. This even the Earl of Stamford, who is made
governor of Hereford, entered the city with a regiment of foot
and some troops of horse, and took up the Bishop's palace for
his quarter and is resolved there to abide: whereupon on
Monday morning we marched towards Worcester, and at the
end of 10 miles came to Bromyard, where we quartered all
night. This day his Excellency proclaimed that all soldiers
that would set to digging should have twelve pence the day,
and enter into pay presently. Tuesday we marched to
Worcester, and were received with much joy, for the design
was so desperate that our judicious friends never looked to
see us again....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,<br />

<span class="pad3">The</span> complaints you preferred to my Lord against
your Lieutenant-Colonel, both by Mr. Lee and your own
Letters, have occasioned his stay here:&mdash;my Lord being so
employed, in regard of many occasions which are upon him,
that he hath not been at leisure to hear him make his defence
which, in pure justice, ought to be granted him or any man
before a judgment be passed upon him.</p>

<p>During his abode here and absence from you, he hath acquainted
me what a grief it is to him to be absent from his
charge, especially now the regiment is called forth to action:
and therefore, asking of me my opinion, I advised him speedily
to repair unto <em>you</em>. Surely you are not well advised thus to
turn off one so faithful to the Cause, and so able to serve you
as this man is. Give me leave to tell you, I cannot be of
your judgment; cannot understand, if a man notorious for
wickedness, for oaths, for drinking, hath as great a share in
your affection as one who fears an oath, who fears to sin,&mdash;that
this doth commend your election of men to serve as fit
instruments in this work!&mdash;</p>

<p>Ay, but the man "is an Anabaptist." Are you sure of
that? Admit he be, shall that render him incapable to serve
the Public? "He is indiscreet." It may be so, in some
things: we have all human infirmities. I tell you, if you had
none but such "indiscreet men" about you, and would be
pleased to use them kindly, you would find as good a fence to
you as any you have yet chosen.</p>

<p>Sir, the State, in choosing men to serve it, takes no notice
of their opinions; if they be willing faithfully to serve it,&mdash;that
satisfies. I advised you formerly to bear with men of
different minds from yourself: if you had done it when I
advised you to it, I think you would not have had so many
stumbling blocks in your way. It may be you judge otherwise;
but I tell you my mind.&mdash;I desire you would receive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
this man into your favour and good opinion. I believe, if he
follow my counsel, he will deserve no other but respect from
you. Take heed of being sharp, or too easily sharpened by
others, against those to whom you can object little but that
they square not with you in every opinion concerning matters
of religion. If there be any other offence to be charged upon
him,&mdash;that must in a judicial way receive determination. I
know you will not think it fit my Lord should discharge an
Officer of the Field but in a regulate way. I question whether
you or I have any precedent for that.</p>

considerations to me when I look upon this present distance

that hostility itself cannot violate my friendship to
your person. But I must be true to the cause wherein I
serve. The old limitation <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">usque ad aras</i>, holds still; and where

<span class="pad3">...</span> In the Grand Committee this afternoon we have
finally agreed on a draft of a letter for the churches abroad
to inform them of our condition, which shortly you will see
in print. Also we have begun one business, (very handsomely
I trust,) of great consequence. In the time of this anarchy
the divisions of the people weekly do much increase: the
Independent party grows; but the Anabaptists more; and the
Antinomians most. The Independents being most able men,
and of great credit, fearing no less than banishment from
their native country if Presbyteries were erected, are watchful
that no conclusion be taken for their prejudice. It was my
advice which Mr. Henderson presently applauded, and gave
me thanks for it, to eschew a public rupture with the Independents,
till we were more able for them. As yet a
Presbytery to this people is conceived to be a strange monster.
It was our good therefore to go on hand in hand, so far as
we did agree, against the common enemy: hoping that in
our differences, when we behooved to come to them, God
would give us light; in the meantime we would assay to
agree upon the Directory of Worship, wherein we expect
no small help from these men, to abolish the Great Idol
of England, the Service-Book, and to erect in all the parts
of worship a full conformity to Scotland in all things
worthy to be spoken of.... This day was proposed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Mr. Solicitor, seconded by Sir Harry Vane, my Lord Say
and my Lord Wharton at our Committee and assented
to by all, that a sub-committee of five, without exclusion
of any of the committee, shall meet with us of Scotland
for preparing a Directory of Worship to be communicated
to the Grand Committee and by them to the Assembly.
Also there is a paper drawn up by Mr. Marshall, in the
name of the chief men of the Assembly and the chief of
the Independents, to be communicated on Monday to the
Assembly and by their advice to be published, declaring the
Assembly's mind to settle, with all speed is possible, all the
questions needful about religion: to reform according to the
word of God all abuses: and to give to every congregation
a person, as their due; whereupon loving and pithy exhortations
are framed to the people, in the name of the men who
are of the greatest credit, to wait patiently for the Assembly's
mind, and to give over that most unreasonable purpose of
their own reformations and gathering of congregations....
Further ways are in hand, which if God bless, the Independents
will either come to us or have very few to follow
them. As for the other sects, wise men are in opinion that
God's favour in this Assembly will make them evanish. We
had great need of your prayers. On Wednesday Mr. Pym
was carried from his house to Westminster on the shoulders,
as the fashion is, of the chief men of the Lower House, all
the House going in procession before him, and before them
the Assembly of Divines. Marshall had a most eloquent
and pertinent funeral sermon, which we would not hear, for
funeral sermons we must have away, with the rest. The
Parliament has ordered to pay his debt, and to build him, in
the chapel of Henry VII., a most stately monument.</p>

<p>... All our company, praise to God, are in good health
and cheerfulness. I must break off: for I must preach to-morrow,
as also my other colleagues.</p>

<p>Lords and commons of England, consider what nation
it is whereof ye are, and whereof ye are the governors: a
nation not slow and dull, but of a quick ingenious and
piercing spirit; acute to invent, subtile and sinewy to discourse
not beneath the reach of any point the highest that
human capacity can soar to.... Now once again by all
concurrence of signs and by the general instinct of holy
and devout men, as they daily and solemnly express their
thoughts, God is decreeing to begin some new and great
period in His church; even to the reformation of reformation
itself; what does He then but reveal Himself to His servants,
and as His manner is, first to His Englishmen? I say, as
His manner is, first to us, though we mark not the method of
His counsels, and are unworthy. Behold now this vast city;
a city of refuge, the mansion-house of liberty, encompassed
and surrounded with His protection: the shop of war hath
not there more anvils and hammers working, to fashion out
the plates and instruments of armed justice in defence of
beleaguered truth, than there be pens and heads there, sitting
by their studious lamps, musing, searching, revolving new
notions and ideas wherewith to present, as with their homage
and their fealty, the approaching Reformation; others as fast
reading, trying all things, assenting to the force of reason
and convincement. What could a man require more from a
nation so pliant and so prone to seek after knowledge? What
wants there to such a toward and pregnant soil but wise and
faithful labourers, to make a knowing people a nation of
prophets, of sages, and of worthies? We reckon more than five
months yet to harvest: there need not be five weeks; had we but
eyes to lift up, the fields are white already. Where there is much
desire to learn, there of necessity will be much arguing, much
writing, many opinions; for opinion in good men is but
knowledge in the making. Under these fantastic terrors of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
sect and schism, we wrong the earnest and zealous thirst after
knowledge and understanding which God hath stirred up in
this city. What some lament, we rather should rejoice at,
should rather praise this pious forwardness among men, to
reassure the ill-deputed care of their religion into their own
hands again. A little generous prudence, a little forbearance
of one another, and some grain of charity, might win all these
diligences to join and unite into one general and brotherly
search after truth; could we but forego this prelatical tradition,
of crowding free consciences and Christian liberties into
canons and precepts of men. I doubt not, if some great and
worthy stranger should come among us, wise to discern the
mould and temper of a people, and how to govern it, observing
the high hopes and aims, the diligent alacrity of our extended
thoughts and reasonings in the pursuance of truth and freedom,
but that he would cry out as Pyrrhus did, admiring the Roman
docility and courage, "If such were my Epirots, I would not
despair the greatest design that could be attempted to make
a church or kingdom happy." Yet these are the men cried out
against for schismatics and sectaries, as if, while the temple
of the Lord was building, some cutting, some squaring the
marble, others hewing the cedars, there should be a sort of irrational
men, who could not consider there must be many schisms
and many dissections made in the quarry and in the timber,
ere the house of God can be built. And when every stone is laid
artfully together, it cannot be united into a continuity, it can
but be contiguous in this world; neither can every piece of
building be of one form; nay rather the perfection consists
in this, that out of many moderate varieties and brotherly
dissimilitudes that are not vastly disproportional, arises the
goodly and the gracious symmetry that commends the whole
pile and structure.... Methinks I see in my mind a noble
and puissant nation rousing herself like a strong man after
sleep and shaking her invincible locks; methinks I see her as
an eagle mewing her mighty youth, and kindling her undazzled
eyes at the full midday beam; purging and unscaling her long
abused sight at the fountain itself of heavenly radiance;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
while the whole noise of timorous and flocking birds, with
those also that love the twilight, flutter about, amazed at
what she means, and in their envious gabble would prognosticate
a year of sects and schisms.</p>

<p>What should you do, then, should ye suppress all this
flowery crop of knowledge and new light sprung up and yet
springing daily in this city? Should ye set up an oligarchy
of twenty engrossers over it, to bring a famine upon our minds
again, when we shall know nothing but what is measured to
us by their bushel? Believe it, lords and commons! they
who counsel you to such a suppressing do as good as bid ye
suppress yourselves; and I will soon show how. If it be
desired to know the immediate cause of all this free writing
and free speaking, there cannot be assigned a truer than your
own mild and free and humane government; it is the liberty,
lords and commons, which your own valorous and happy
counsels have purchased us; liberty, which is the nurse of all
great arts: this it is which hath rarefied and enlightened our
spirits like the influence of Heaven; this is that which hath
enfranchised, enlarged, and lifted up our apprehensions
degrees above themselves. Ye cannot make us now less
capable, less knowing, less eagerly pursuing of the truth,
unless ye first make yourselves, that made us so, less the
lovers, less the founders of our true liberty. We cannot
grow ignorant again, brutish, formal and slavish, as ye found
us: but you then must first become that which ye cannot be,
oppressive, arbitrary, and tyrannous; as they were from
whom ye have freed us. That our hearts are now more
capacious, our thoughts more erected to the search and
expectation of greatest and exactest things, is the issue of
your own virtue propagated in us; ye cannot suppress that
unless ye reinforce an abrogated and merciless law, that
fathers may despatch at will their own children.... Give me
the liberty to know, to utter, and to argue freely according to
conscience, above all liberties.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">May it please Your Sacred Majesty</span>:&mdash;<br />

<span class="pad3">The</span> last dispatch I sent your Majesty word by my
worthy friend, and your Majesty's brave servant, Sir William
Rollock, from Kintore, near Aberdeen, dated the 14th of
September last; wherein I acquainted your Majesty with the
good success of your arms in this kingdom, and of the battles
the justice of your cause has won over your obdurate rebel
subjects. Since Sir William Rollock went I have traversed
all the north of Scotland up to Argyle's country; who durst
not stay my coming, or I should have given your Majesty a
good account of him ere now. But at last I have met with
him, yesterday, to his cost; of which your gracious Majesty
be pleased to receive the following particulars.</p>

<p>After I had laid waste the whole country of Argyle, and
brought off provisions, for my army, of what could be found,
I received information that Argyle was got together with a
considerable army, made up chiefly of his own clan, and
vassals and tenants, with others of the rebels that joined
him, and that he was at Inverlochy, where he expected the
Earl of Seaforth, and the sept of the Frasers, to come up to
him with all the forces they could get together. Upon
this intelligence I departed out of Argyleshire, and marched
through Lorn, Glencow, and Aber, till I came to Lochness, my
design being to fall upon Argyle before Seaforth and the
Frasers could join him. My march was through inaccessible
mountains, where I could have no guides but cow-herds,
and they scarce acquainted with a place but six miles from
their own habitations. If I had been attacked but with
one hundred men in some of these passes, I must have certainly
returned back, for it would have been impossible to
force my way, most of the passes being so strait that three
men could not march abreast. I was willing to let the world
see that Argyle was not the man his Highlandmen believed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
him to be, and that it was possible to beat him in his own
Highlands. The difficultest march of all was over the Lochaber
mountains, which we at last surmounted, and came upon the
back of the enemy when they least expected us, having cut
off some scouts we met about four miles from Inverlochy.
Our van came within view of them about five o'clock in the
afternoon, and we made a halt till our rear was got up, which
could not be done till eight at night. The rebels took the
alarm and stood to their arms, as well as we, all night, which
was moonlight, and very clear. There were some few skirmishes
between the rebels and us all the night, and with no
loss on our side but one man. By break of day I ordered my
men to be ready to fall on upon the first signal, and I understand
since, by the prisoners, the rebels did the same. A
little after the sun was up, both armies met, and the rebels
fought for some time with great bravery, the prime of the
Campbells giving the first onset, as men that deserved to fight
in a better cause. Our men, having a nobler cause, did
wonders, and came immediately to push of pike, and dint of
sword, after their first firing. The rebels could not stand it,
but, after some resistance at first, began to run, whom we
pursued for nine miles together, making a great slaughter,
which I would have hindered, if possible, that I might save
your Majesty's misled subjects, for well I know your Majesty
does not delight in their blood, but in their returning to their
duty. There were at least fifteen hundred killed in the
battle and the pursuit, among whom there are a great many
of the most considerable gentlemen of the name of Campbell,
and some of them nearly related to the Earl. I have saved
and taken prisoners several of them, that have acknowledged
to me their fault and lay all the blame on their Chief. Some
gentlemen of the Lowlands, that had behaved themselves
bravely in the battle, when they saw all lost, fled into the old
castle, and, upon their surrender, I have treated them honourably,
and taken their parole never to bear arms against your
Majesty.</p>

<p>We have of your Majesty's army about two hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
wounded, but I hope few of them dangerously. I can hear
but of four killed, and one whom I cannot name to your
Majesty but with grief of mind, Sir Thomas Ogilvy, a son of
the Earl of Airly's, of whom I writ to your Majesty in
my last. He is not yet dead, but they say he cannot
possibly live, and we give him over for dead. Your Majesty
had never a truer servant, nor there never was a braver,
honester gentleman. For the rest of the particulars of
this action, I refer myself to the bearer, Mr. Hay, whom
your Majesty knows already, and therefore I need not recommend
him.</p>

<p>Now, Sacred Sir, let me humbly intreat your Majesty's
pardon if I presume to write you my poor thoughts and
opinion about what I heard by a letter I received from my
friends in the south, last week, as if your Majesty was entering
into a treaty with your rebel Parliament in England. The
success of your arms in Scotland does not more rejoice my
heart, as that news from England is like to break it. And
whatever come of me, I will speak my mind freely to your
Majesty, for it is not mine, but your Majesty's interest I
seek.</p>

<p>When I had the honour of waiting upon your Majesty last,
I told you at full length what I fully understood of the designs
of your Rebel subjects in both kingdoms, which I had occasion
to know as much as any one whatsoever; being at that time,
as they thought, entirely in their interest. Your Majesty may
remember how much you said you were convinced I was in
the right in my opinion of them. I am sure there is nothing
fallen out since to make your Majesty change your judgment
in all those things I laid before your Majesty at that time.
The more your Majesty grants, the more will be asked; and
I have too much reason to know that they will not rest satisfied
with less than making your Majesty a King of straw. I hope
the news I have received about a treaty may be a mistake,
and the rather that the letter wherewith the Queen was pleased
to honour me, dated the 30th of December, mentions no
such thing. Yet I know not what to make of the intelligence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
I received, since it comes from Sir Robert Spottiswood, who
writes it with a great regret; and it is no wonder, considering
no man living is a more true subject to your Majesty than he.
Forgive me, Sacred Sovereign, to tell your Majesty that, in
my poor opinion, it is unworthy of a King to treat with Rebel
subjects, while they have the sword in their hands. And
though God forbid I should stint your Majesty's mercy, yet
I must declare the horror I am in when I think of a treaty,
while your Majesty and they are in the field with two armies,
unless they disband, and submit themselves entirely to your
Majesty's goodness and pardon.</p>

<p>As to the state of affairs in this Kingdom, the bearer will
fully inform your Majesty in every particular. And give me
leave, with all humility, to assure your Majesty that, through
God's blessing, I am in the fairest hopes of reducing this
kingdom to your Majesty's obedience. And, if the measures
I have concerted with your other loyal subjects fail me not,
which they hardly can, I doubt not before the end of this
summer I shall be able to come to your Majesty's assistance
with a brave army, which, backed with the justice of your
Majesty's cause, will make the Rebels in England, as well as
in Scotland, feel the just rewards of Rebellion. Only give
me leave, after I have reduced this country to your Majesty's
obedience, and <em>conquered from Dan to Beersheba</em>, to say to
your Majesty then, as David's General did to his master,
"<em>Come thou thyself, lest this country be called by my name</em>."
For in all my actions I aim only at your Majesty's honour
and interest, as becomes one that is to his last breath, may it
please your Sacred Majesty,&mdash;</p>

<span class="pad3">These</span> two last weeks I heard not from thee, nor any
about thee, which hath made my present condition the more
troublesome, but I expect daily the contentment of hearing
from thee. Indeed I have need of some comfort, for I never
knew what it was to be barbarously baited before, and these
five or six days last have much surpassed, in rude pressures
against my conscience, all the rest since I came to the Scotch
army; for, upon I know not what intelligence from London,
nothing must serve but my signing the covenant (the last
was, my commanding all my subjects to do it), declaring
absolutely, and without reserve, for Presbyterian government,
and my receiving the Directory in my family, with an
absolute command for the rest of the kingdom; and if I did
not all this, then a present agreement must be made with the
parliament, without regard of me, for they said that otherways
they could not hope for peace or a just war. It is true they
gave me many other fair promises in case I did what they
desired (and yet for the militia they daily give ground);
but I answered them, that what they demanded was absolutely
against my conscience, which might be persuaded, but
would not be forced by anything they could speak or do.
This was the sum of divers debates and papers between us,
of which I cannot now give thee an account. At last
I made them be content with another message to London,
requiring an answer to my former, with an offer to go thither
upon honourable and just conditions. Thus all I can do is
but delaying of ill, which I shall not be able to do long without
assistance from thee. I cannot but again remember thee,
that there was never man so alone as I, and therefore very
much to be excused for the committing of any error, because
I have reason to suspect everything that these advised me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
and to distrust mine own single opinion, having no living soul
to help me. To conclude, all the comfort I have is in thy
love and a clear conscience.</p>

<p>I know the first will not fail me, nor (by the grace of God)
the other. Only I desire thy particular help, that I should
be as little vexed as may be; for, if thou do not, I care not
much for others. I need say no more of this, nor will at this
time, but that I am eternally thine.</p>

<p>In the meantime I observed that another party was not
idle: for, walking one morning with Lieutenant-General
Cromwell in Sir Robert Cotton's garden, he inveighed bitterly
against them, saying in a familiar way to me, "If thy father
were alive, he would let some of them hear what they
deserve," adding further "that it was a miserable thing to
serve a Parliament, to whom let a man be never so faithful,
if one pragmatical fellow amongst them rise up and asperse
him, he shall never wipe it off. Whereas," said he, "when
one serves under a general, he may do as much service,
and yet be free from all blame and envy." This text,
together with the comment that his after-actions put upon
it, hath since persuaded me that he had already conceived
the design of destroying the civil authority, and setting
up of himself; and that he took that opportunity to feel
my pulse, whether I were a fit instrument to be employed by
him to those ends. But having replied to his discourse,
that we ought to perform the duty of our stations, and
trust God with our honour, power, and all that is dear to us,
not permitting any such considerations to discourage us from
the prosecution of our duty, I never heard any more from
him upon that point.</p>

<p>Part of the Debate on the Agreement of the People, First
article, "That the people of England being at this day very
unequally distributed by Counties, Cities and Boroughs for
the election of their Deputies in Parliament, ought to be more
indifferently proportioned according to the number of the
inhabitants."</p>

<p><em>Col. Rainborough.</em> Really I think that the poorest he that
is in England hath a life to live as the greatest he; and
therefore truly, Sir, I think it's clear that every man that is
to live under a Government ought first by his own consent
to put himself under that Government....</p>

<p><em>Commissary Ireton.</em> Give me leave to tell you, that if you
make this the rule I think you must fly for refuge to an
absolute natural Right, and you must deny all Civil Right....
For my part I think it is no right at all. I think that no person
hath a right to an interest or share in the disposing or determining
of the affairs of the Kingdom, and in choosing those
that shall determine what laws we shall be ruled by here, no
person hath a right to this that hath not a permanent fixed
interest in this Kingdom.... We talk of birthright. Truly by
birthright there is thus much claim. Men may justly have
by birthright, by their very being born in England, that we
shall not seclude them out of England, that we shall not refuse
to give them air and place and ground and the freedom of the
highways and other things, to live amongst us.... That I
think is due to a man by birth. But that by a man's being born
here he shall have a share in that power that shall dispose of
the lands here, and of all things here, I do not think it a
sufficient ground. I am sure if we look upon ... that which is
most radical and fundamental and which if you take away
there is no man hath any land, any goods, any civil interest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
that is this; that those that choose the representors for the
making of laws by which this state and kingdom are to be
governed, are the persons who taken together do comprehend
the local interest of this kingdom: that is, the persons in
whom all land lies, and those in Corporations in whom all
trading lies....</p>

<p><em>Rainborough.</em> Truly, Sir, I am of the same opinion I was;
and am resolved to keep it till I know reason why I
should not. I do think the main cause why Almighty God
gave men reason, it was, that they should make use of that
reason. Half a loaf is better than none if a man be an hungry,
yet I think there is nothing that God hath given a man that
any else can take from him. I do not find anything in the
law of God, that a Lord shall choose 20 burgesses and a gentleman
but two, and a poor man shall choose none. But I do
find that all Englishmen must be subject to English laws, and
I do verily believe that there is no man but will say that the
foundation of all law lies in the people....</p>

<p><em>Ireton.</em> I wish we may all consider of what right you will
challenge, that all people should have right to elections. Is
it by the right of nature? By that same right of nature by
which you can say one man hath an equal right with another
to the choosing of him that shall govern him&mdash;by the same
right of nature, he hath an equal right in any goods he sees;
meat, drink, clothes, to take and use them for his sustenance.
He hath a freedom to the land, to exercise it, till it; he hath
the same freedom to anything that anyone doth account himself
to have any property in.... Since you cannot plead it by
anything but the law of nature, I would fain have any man
show me their bounds, where you will end, and why you should
not take away all property?</p>

<p><em>Rainborough.</em> I wish we were all true hearted, and that we
did all carry ourselves with integrity. For my part, I think
you do not only yourselves believe that we are inclining to
anarchy, but you would make all men believe that. That
there is property the Law of God says, else why hath God
made that law, "Thou shalt not steal"? If I have no interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
in the Kingdom I must suffer by all their laws, be they
right or wrong. I am a poor man, therefore I must be oppressed....</p>

<p><em>Cromwell.</em> I know nothing but this, that they that are the
most yielding have the greatest reason; but really, Sir, this
is not right as it should be. No man says you have a mind to
anarchy, but the consequence of this rule tends to anarchy,
must end in anarchy, for where is there any bound or limit
set, if you take away this limit, that men that have no interest
but the interest of breathing, shall have no voice in elections?
Therefore I am confident on it that we should not be so hot
one with another....</p>

<p><em>Rainborough.</em> I deny that there is property, to a Lord, to a
Gentleman, to any man more than another in the Kingdom
of England. I would fain know what we have fought for.
This is the old law of England, and that which enslaves the
people of England, that they should be bound by laws in
which they have no voice at all....</p>

<p><em>Mr. Sexby.</em> We have engaged in this Kingdom and ventured
our lives, and it was all for this: to recover our birthrights
and privileges as Englishmen, and by the arguments used
there is none. There are many thousands of us soldiers that
have ventured our lives: we have had little property in the
Kingdom as to our estates; yet we have had a birthright. It
seems now, unless a man hath a fixed estate in this Kingdom,
he hath no right in this kingdom. I wonder we were so much
deceived. I shall tell you in a word my resolution. I am
resolved to give my birthright to none. I do think the poor
and meaner of this kingdom have been the means of the preservation
of this kingdom....</p>

<p><em>Ireton.</em> For my part, rather than I will make a disturbance
to a good Constitution of a kingdom wherein I may live in
godliness and honesty and peace and quietness, I will part
with a great deal of my birthright. I will part with my own
property rather than I will be the man that shall make a
disturbance in the Kingdom for my property....</p>

<p><em>Rainborough.</em> But I would fain know what the poor soldier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
hath fought for all this while? He hath fought to enslave
himself, to give power to men of riches, men of estates, to
make him a perpetual slave. We do find in all presses that
go forth none must be pressed that are freehold men. When
these Gentlemen fall out among themselves they shall press
the poor scrubs to come and kill them.</p>

<p><em>Cromwell.</em> I confess I am most dissatisfied with that I heard
Mr. Sexby speak of any man here, because it did savour so
much of will. But I desire that all of us may decline that,
and if we meet here really to agree to that which is for the
safety of the Kingdom, let us not spend so much time in such
debates as these are. If we think to bring it to an issue this
way I know our debates are endless, and I think if you do
desire to bring this to a result it were well if we may but
resolve upon a Committee. I say it again, if I cannot be
satisfied to go so far as these Gentlemen ... I shall freely
and willingly withdraw myself, and I hope to do it in such
manner that the Army shall see that I shall by my withdrawing
satisfy the interest of the Army, the public interest
of the Kingdom, and those ends these men aim at.</p>

Peace upon Grounds of Common Right.</span></p>


<p>Having by our late labours and hazards made it appear to
the world at how high a rate we value our just freedom, and
God having so far owned our cause as to deliver the enemies
thereof into our hands, we do now hold ourselves bound in
mutual duty to each other to take the best care we can for
the future to avoid both the danger of returning into a slavish
condition and the chargeable remedy of another war; for,
it cannot be imagined that so many of our countrymen would
have opposed us in this quarrel if they had understood their
own good, so may we safely promise to ourselves that, when
our common rights and liberties shall be cleared, their en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>deavours
will be disappointed that seek to make themselves
our masters.</p>

<p>Since, therefore, our former oppressions and scarce-yet-ended
troubles have been occasioned, either by want of frequent
national meetings in Council, or by rendering those
meetings ineffectual, we are fully agreed and resolved to
provide that hereafter our representatives be neither left to
an uncertainty for the time nor made useless to the ends for
which they are intended.</p>

<p>In order whereunto we declare:&mdash;</p>


<p class="pfs100">I.</p>

<p>That the people of England, being at this day very unequally
distributed by Counties, Cities, and Boroughs, ought
to be more indifferently proportioned according to the number
of the inhabitants; the circumstances whereof for number,
place, and manner are to be set down before the end of this
present Parliament.</p>


<p class="pfs100">II.</p>

<p>That, to prevent the many inconveniences apparently
arising from the long continuance of the same persons in
authority, this present Parliament be dissolved upon the last
day of September which shall be in the year of our Lord,
1648.</p>


<p class="pfs100">III.</p>

<p>That the people do, of course, choose themselves a Parliament
once in two years, viz. upon the first Thursday in every
2d March, after the manner as shall be prescribed before this
present Parliament end, to begin to sit upon the first Thursday
in April following, at Westminster or such other place as shall
be appointed from time to time by the preceding Representatives,
and to continue till the last day of September then next
ensuing, and no longer.</p>


<p class="pfs100">IV.</p>

<p>That the power of this, and all future Representatives of
this Nation, is inferior only to theirs who choose them, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
doth extend, without the consent or concurrence of any other
person or persons, to the enacting, altering, and repealing
of laws, to the erecting and abolishing of offices and courts,
to the appointing, removing, and calling to account magistrates
and officers of all degrees, to the making war and
peace, to the treating with foreign States, and, generally, to
whatsoever is not expressly or impliedly reserved by the
represented to themselves.</p>

<p>Which are as followeth.</p>

<p>1. That matters of religion and the ways of God's worship
are not at all entrusted by us to any human power, because
therein we cannot remit or exceed a tittle of what our consciences
dictate to be the mind of God without wilful sin:
nevertheless the public way of instructing the nation (so it
be not compulsive) is referred to their discretion.</p>

<p>2. That the matter of impresting and constraining any of
us to serve in the wars is against our freedom; and therefore
we do not allow it in our Representatives; the rather, because
money (the sinews of war), being always at their disposal,
they can never want numbers of men apt enough to engage
in any just cause.</p>

<p>3. That after the dissolution of this present Parliament, no
person be at any time questioned for anything said or done
in reference to the late public differences, otherwise than in
execution of the judgments of the present Representatives or
House of Commons.</p>

<p>4. That in all laws made or to be made every person may
be bound alike, and that no tenure, estate, charter, degree,
birth, or place do confer any exemption from the ordinary
course of legal proceedings whereunto others are subjected.</p>

<p>5. That as the laws ought to be equal, so they must be
good, and not evidently destructive to the safety and well-being
of the people.</p>

<p>These things we declare to be our native rights, and therefore
are agreed and resolved to maintain them with our utmost
possibilities against all opposition whatsoever; being com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>pelled
thereunto not only by the examples of our ancestors,
whose blood was often spent in vain for the recovery of their
freedoms, suffering themselves through fraudulent accommodations
to be still deluded of the fruit of their victories, but
also by our own woeful experience, who, having long expected
and dearly earned the establishment of these certain rules of
government, are yet made to depend for the settlement of our
peace and freedom upon him that intended our bondage and
brought a cruel war upon us.</p>

in judgment and conscience satisfied that he, the said Charles

<p>To speak first of his private qualifications as a man, before
the mention of his princely and royal virtues: he was, if ever
any, the most worthy of the title of an honest man; so great
a love of justice, that no temptation could dispose him to a
wrongful action, except it was so disguised to him that he
believed it to be just. He had a tenderness and compassion
of nature, which restrained him from ever doing a hard-hearted
thing; and therefore he was so apt to grant pardons
to malefactors, that the judges of the land represented the
damage and insecurity to the public, that flowed from such
his indulgence. And then he restrained himself from pardoning
either murders or highway robberies, and quickly discerned
the fruits of his severity by a wonderful reformation
of those enormities. He was very punctual and regular in
his devotions; he was never known to enter upon his recreations
or sports, though never so early in the morning, before
he had been at public prayers, so that on hunting days his
chaplains were bound to a very early attendance. He was
likewise very strict in observing the hours of his private
cabinet devotions, and was so severe an exactor of gravity
and reverence in all mention of religion, that he could never
endure any light or profane word in religion, with what sharpness
of wit soever it was covered; and though he was well
pleased and delighted with reading verses made upon any
occasion, no man durst bring before him anything that was
profane or unclean. That kind of wit had never any countenance
then. He was so great an example of conjugal affection,
that they that did not imitate him in that particular
did not brag of their liberty: and he did not only permit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
but direct his bishops to prosecute those scandalous vices,
in the ecclesiastical courts, against persons of eminence and
near relation to his service.</p>

<p>His kingly virtues had some mixture and alloy, that hindered
them from shining in full lustre, and from producing those
fruits they should have been attended with. He was not in
his nature very bountiful, though he gave very much. This
appeared more after the Duke of Buckingham's death, after
which those showers fell very rarely: and he paused too long
in giving, which made those to whom he gave less sensible
of the benefit. He kept State to the full, which made his
Court very orderly; no man presuming to be seen in a place
where he had no pretence to be. He saw and observed men
long before he received any about his person; and did not
love strangers, nor very confident men. He was a patient
hearer of causes, which he frequently accustomed himself to
at the council board, and judged very well, and was dextrous
in the mediating part: so that he often put an end to causes
by persuasion, which the stubbornness of men's humours made
dilatory in courts of justice.</p>

<p>He was very fearless in his person, but not very enterprising.
He had an excellent understanding, but was not
confident enough of it; which made him oftentimes change
his opinion for a worse, and follow the advice of men that did
not judge so well as himself. This made him more irresolute
than the conjuncture of his affairs would admit: if he had
been of a rougher and more imperious nature he would have
found more respect and duty. And his not applying some
severe cures to approaching evils proceeded from the lenity
of his nature, and the tenderness of his conscience, which,
in all cases of blood, made him choose the softer way, and
not hearken to severe counsels how reasonably soever urged.
This only restrained him from pursuing his advantage in
the first Scots expedition, when, humanly speaking, he
might have reduced that nation to the most slavish obedience
that could have been wished. But no man can
say he had then many who advised him to it, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
contrary, by a wonderful indisposition all his council had to
fighting, or any other fatigue. He was always an immoderate
lover of the Scottish nation, having not only been born there,
but educated by that people and besieged by them always,
having few English about him till he was king; and the major
number of his servants being still of that nation, who he
thought could never fail him. And among these, no man had
such an ascendant over him, as Duke Hamilton had.</p>

<p>As he excelled in all other virtues, so in temperance he was
so strict, that he abhorred all debauchery to that degree, that,
at a great festival solemnity, where he once was, when very
many of the nobility of the English and Scots were entertained,
being told by one who withdrew from thence, what
vast draughts of wine they drank, and "that there was one
earl who had drunk most of the rest down, and was not
himself moved or altered," the King said, "that he deserved
to be hanged," and that earl coming shortly after into the
room where his majesty was, in some gaiety, to show how
unhurt he was from that battle, the king sent one to bid him
withdraw from his Majesty's presence; nor did he in some
days after appear before him.</p>

<p>So many miraculous circumstances contributed to his ruin
that men might well think that heaven and earth and the
stars designed it. Though he was, from the first declension
of his power, so much betrayed by his own servants, that
there were very few who remained faithful to him, yet that
treachery preceded not from any treasonable purpose to do
him any harm, but from particular animosities against other
men. And afterwards the terror all men were under of the
Parliament, and the guilt they were conscious of themselves,
made them watch all opportunities to make themselves
gracious to those who could do them good; and so they became
spies upon their master, and from one piece of knavery were
hardened and confirmed to undertake another; till at last
they had no hope of preservation but by the destruction of
their master. And after all this, when a man might reasonably
believe that less than a universal defection of three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
nations could not have reduced a great king to so ugly a fate,
it is most certain that, in that very hour when he was thus
wickedly murdered in the sight of the sun, he had as great a
share in the hearts and affections of his subjects in general,
was as much beloved, esteemed, and longed for by the people
in general of the three nations, as any of his predecessors
had ever been. To conclude, he was the worthiest gentleman,
the best friend, the best husband, the best father, and
the best Christian, that the age in which he lived had produced.
And if he were not the best king, if he were without some
parts and qualities which have made some kings great and
happy, no other prince was ever so unhappy who was possessed
of half his virtues and endowments, and so much
without any kind of vice.</p>

Levellers at St. <em>Margaret's</em> Hill, near <em>Cobham</em> in <em>Surrey</em>, and
at St. <em>George's</em> Hill, and that they digged the Ground, and

Park Pales, and to lay all open, and threaten the Neighbours
that they will shortly make them all come up to the Hills

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>Everard said, he was of the Race of the Jews, that all the
Liberties of the People were lost by the coming in of William
the Conqueror, and that ever since, the People of God had
lived under Tyranny and Oppression worse than that of our
Forefathers under the Egyptians.</p>

<p>But now the time of the Deliverance was at hand, and God
would bring his People out of this Slavery, and restore them
to their Freedom in enjoying the Fruits and Benefits of the
Earth.</p>

<p>And that there had lately appeared to him a Vision, which
bad him arise and dig and plow the Earth, and receive the
Fruits thereof, that their Intent is to restore the Creation to
its former condition.</p>

<p>That as God had promised to make the barren Land fruitful,
so now what they did, was to renew the ancient Community
of enjoying the Fruits of the Earth, and to distribute
the Benefit thereof to the poor and needy, and to feed the
hungry and clothe the naked.</p>

<p>That they intend not to meddle with any Man's Property,
nor to break down any Pales or Inclosures; but only to meddle
with what was common and untilled, and to make it fruitful
for the use of Man; that the time will suddenly be, that all
Men shall willingly come in, and give up their Lands and
Estates, and submit to this Community.</p>

<p>And for those that will come in and work, they should have
Meat, Drink, and Clothes, which is all that is necessary to the
Life of Man, and that for Money there was not any need of it,
nor of Clothes more than to cover Nakedness.</p>

<p>That they will not defend themselves by Arms, but will
submit unto Authority, and wait till the promised Opportunity
be offered, which they conceive to be at hand. And
that as their Forefathers lived in Tents, so it would be suitable
to their Condition now to live in the same, with more

<p class="pfs90"><b>Source.</b>&mdash;Carlyle, <cite>Letter IV.: To the Speaker</cite>, September 17, 1649.</p>


<p>... Upon Tuesday the 10th of this instant, about five
o'clock in the evening, we began the storm; and after some
hot dispute we entered, about seven or eight hundred men;
the enemy disputing it very stiffly with us. And indeed,
through the advantages of the place, and the courage God
was pleased to give the defenders, our men were forced to
retreat quite out of the breach, not without some considerable
loss; Colonel Castle being there shot in the head, whereof
he presently died; and divers other officers and men doing
their duty killed and wounded. There was a "Tenalia"<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
to flank the south wall of the Town, between Duleek Gate
and the corner Tower before mentioned;&mdash;which our men
entered, wherein they found some forty or fifty of the Enemy,
which they put to the sword. And this they held: but it
being without the Wall, and the sally-port through the Wall
into that Tenalia being choked up with some of the Enemy
which were killed in it, it proved of no use for an entrance
into the Town that way.</p>

<p>Although our men that stormed the breaches were forced
to recoil, as is before expressed; yet, being encouraged to
recover their loss, they made a second attempt: wherein God
was pleased so to animate them that they got ground of the
Enemy, and by the goodness of God, forced him to quit his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
entrenchments. And after a very hot dispute, the Enemy
having both horse and foot, and we only foot, within the Wall,&mdash;they
gave ground, and our men became masters both of
their entrenchments and of the Church; which indeed,
although they made our entrance the more difficult, yet they
proved of excellent use to us; so that the Enemy could
not now annoy us with their horse, but thereby we had
advantage to make good the ground, that so we might let
in our own horse; which accordingly was done, though with
much difficulty.</p>

<p>Divers of the Enemy retreated into the Mill-Mount: a
place very strong and of difficult access; being exceedingly
high, having a good graft, and strongly palisadoed. The
Governor, Sir Arthur Ashton, and divers considerable Officers
being there, our men getting up to them, were ordered by
me to put them all to the sword. And indeed, being in the
heat of action, I forbade them to spare any that were in
arms in the Town: and, I think, that night they put to the
sword about 2,000 men;&mdash;divers of the officers and soldiers
being fled over the Bridge into the other part of the Town,
where about 100 of them possessed St. Peter's Church-steeple,
some the west Gate, and others a strong Round Tower next
the Gate called St. Sunday's. These being summoned to
yield to mercy, refused. Whereupon I ordered the steeple
of St. Peter's Church to be fired, when one of them was heard
to say in the midst of the flames: "God damn me, God confound
me; I burn, I burn."</p>

<p>The next day, the other two Towers were summoned; in
one of which was about six or seven score; but they refused
to yield themselves: and we knowing that hunger must
compel them, set only good guards to secure them from
running away until their stomachs were come down. From
one of the said Towers, notwithstanding their condition, they
killed and wounded some of our men. When they submitted,
their officers were knocked on the head; and every tenth
man of the soldiers killed; and the rest shipped for the
Barbadoes. The soldiers in the other Tower were all spared,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
as to their lives only; and shipped likewise for the Barbadoes.</p>

<p>I am persuaded that this is a righteous judgment of God
upon these barbarous wretches, who have imbrued their
hands in so much innocent blood; and that it will tend to
prevent the effusion of blood for the future. Which are the
satisfactory grounds to such actions, which otherwise cannot
but work remorse and regret. The officers and soldiers of
this Garrison were the flower of their army. And their great
expectation was, that our attempting this place would put
fair to ruin us; they being confident of the resolution of their
men, and the advantage of the place. If we had divided our
force into two quarters to have besieged the North Town and
the South Town, we could not have had such a correspondency
between the two parts of our Army, but that they might have
chosen to have brought their Army, and have fought with
which part of ours they pleased,&mdash;and at the same time
have made a sally with 2,000 men upon us, and have left their
walls manned; they having in the Town the number hereafter
specified, but some say near 4,000....</p>

<p>And now give me leave to say how it comes to pass that
this work is wrought. It was set upon some of our hearts,
that a great thing should be done, not by power or might,
but by the Spirit of God. And is it not so, clearly? That
which caused your men to storm so courageously, it was the
Spirit of God, who gave your men courage, and took it away
again; and gave the Enemy courage, and took it away again;
and gave your men courage again, and therewith this happy
success. And therefore it is good that God alone have all
the glory.</p>

<p>But as men, for the attaining of peace, and conservation of
themselves thereby, have made an Artificial Man, which we
call a Common-wealth; so also have they made Artificial
Chains, called civil laws, which they themselves, by mutual
covenants, have fastened at one end, to the lips of that man,
or assembly, to whom they have given the sovereign power;
and at the other end to their own ears. These Bonds, in their
own nature but weak, may neverthelesse be made to hold, by
the danger, though not by the difficulty, of breaking them.</p>

<p>In relation to these Bonds only it is, that I am to speak
now, of the <em>Liberty</em> of <em>Subjects</em>. For seeing there is no Common-wealth
in the world, wherein there be rules enough set
down, for the regulating of all the actions, and words of men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
(as being a thing impossible:) it followeth necessarily, that
in all kinds of actions, by the laws prætermitted, men have
the Liberty of doing what their own reasons shall suggest,
for the most profitable to themselves. For if we take Liberty
in the proper sense, for corporal Liberty; that is to say,
freedom from chains and prison, it were very absurd for men
to clamor as they do, for the Liberty they so manifestly enjoy.
Again, if we take Liberty for an exemption from Laws, it is
no less absurd for men to demand, as they do, that Liberty,
by which all other men may be masters of their lives. And
yet as absurd as it is, this is it they demand; not knowing
that the laws are of no power to protect them, without a
sword in the hands of a man, or men, to cause those laws to
be put in execution. The Liberty of a Subject lieth therefore
only in those things which, in regulating their actions,
the Sovereign hath prætermitted: such as is the Liberty to
buy, and sell, and otherwise contract with one another; to
choose their own abode, their own diet, their own trade of
life, and institute their children as they themselves think fit;
and the like.</p>

<p>Neverthelesse we are not to understand, that by such
Liberty, the Sovereign Power of life and death is either
abolished or limited. For it has been already shewn, that
nothing the Sovereign Representative can do to a Subject,
on what pretence soever, can properly be called Injustice, or
Injury; because every subject is author of every act the
Sovereign doth; so that he never wanteth Right to any thing,
otherwise than as he himself is the Subject of God, and
bound thereby to observe the laws of Nature. And therefore
it may, and doth often happen in Common-wealths, that a
Subject may be put to death by the command of the Sovereign
Power; and yet neither do the other wrong: As when Jeptha
caused his daughter to be sacrificed: In which, and the like
cases, he that so dieth had Liberty to do the action, for which
he is neverthelesse without injury put to death. And the
same holdeth also in a Sovereign Prince, that putteth to
death an innocent subject. For though the action be against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
the law of Nature, as being contrary to Equity, (as was the
killing of Uriah by David;) yet it was not an injury to Uriah;
but to God. Not to Uriah, because the right to do what he
pleased was given him by Uriah himself. And yet to God,
because David was God's Subject; and prohibited all iniquity
by the law of Nature. Which distinction David himself,
when he repented the fact, evidently confirmed, saying, <em>To
Thee only have I sinned</em>.</p>

Fight between the English and the Dutch Fleets in the Downs
on Wednesday, May 19, 1652.</cite> Brit. Mus., E. 665.</p>

<p class="pfs100"><em>To Mr. Richard Bostock of London, Merchant.</em></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Worthy Sir</span>,<br />

<span class="pad3">My</span> service to you, wishing all happiness. On the
18th of May inst. the Hollanders' fleet, consisting of 42 sail
of stout ships, all men of war, came by the Eastward, and lay
by the lee of the South Foreland, and from thence sent two
of their fleet into the Downs to Major Bourn, who was then
Admiral (General Blake being absent). The Captains of those
ships, coming aboard, desired leave of him to anchor their
ships in the Downs. The Admiral asked them why they
came into our seas with their flags up, so near our Navy.
They answered they had orders not to strike their flags to
any they should meet with; whereupon the Major answered
them, that within two days' time they should know whether
there was room enough for them to anchor in or not. Yet
notwithstanding this the Hollanders anchored in Dover road,
and rode there till the 19th. About two of the clock in the
afternoon, Major Bourne came out of the Downs into Dover
road with 10 sail, and Col. Blake from the rest with 13 sail
more: the Dutch Fleet, seeing this, weighed anchor, and
stood up to the coast of France with their flags up, near upon
two hours, and then bore up to Gen. Blake, each ship having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
a man at the topmast head, as if they intended to have struck
their flags.</p>

<p>When they came within shot of our Admiral, he made one
shot at them for to strike, but they refused, still coming
towards him, whereupon he made two shot more at them, and
then the Hollanders gave him one shot, still making nearer
to him; and coming up to him, saluted our Admiral with a
whole volley of small shot and a broadside of gunshot, and
Col. Blake returned him the like, and bearing up after him,
they two charged three or four broadsides at each other.
Thirteen of the Hollanders gave our Admiral each of them a
broadside, before any of our ships came up to second him;
then the <em>General of Folkestone</em> came up between the Hollanders
and our Admiral, and gave them a breathing time,
and in an hour's time the ship called the <i>Triumph</i> came up
to them and fell up into the whole fleet.</p>

<p>About six of the clock at night the Dutch Admiral bore
away, and Gen. Blake after him; but Van Tromp went better
than our Admiral, insomuch that he could not come up with
them, but followed them within shot till nine of the clock,
in which time the Hollanders had so shattered our General's
sails and rigging, that they had neither sheets, tacks, nor
brace, and his foresail was all torn in pieces; by means whereof
Van Tromp sailed away and all his fleet after him; only
one of our Frigates boarded one of them who had 150 in her;
whereof 50 were slain and the rest wounded and taken: we
also shot another Dutch ship's mainmast overboard and took
her, she having 37 guns in her, but finding six foot of water
in her hold, we only took out the Captain and two more, and
left her not able to swim, but sank shortly afterwards....</p>

<p>Our ships are all now (God be praised) safe in the Downs,
and have brought in two Hollanders, one of them thought
to be an Adviser. I was aboard our fleet in the Downs, and
there came six Hollanders that were merchantmen within a
league of our fleet, whereupon a Frigate of ours came up to
the Admiral, and asked leave to fetch them in; but the
Admiral answered that they were men about honest occasions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
and he had no order from the Council of State to meddle with
them, and so let them pass about their occasions.</p>

<p>While I was aboard the Admiral, there came a Dutch
man-of-war, supposing it to be Van Tromp, but the <i>Speaker</i>
Frigate quickly fetched him up, and brought him into our
fleet.</p>

<p>There were 36 of the Hollanders ships that engaged with
our fleet in the aforesaid fight, that ride about deep, every one
of them being about 1,000 or 1,500 tons, most of them pitifully
torn and battered, and many of them without either
mast, sails, or flags, having lost the company of their Admiral.</p>

<p>I pressed the Parliament, as a member, to period themselves&mdash;once,
and again, and again, and ten, nay twenty
times over. I told them&mdash;for I knew it better than any one
man in the Parliament could know it, because of my manner
of life which led me everywhere up and down the nation,
thereby giving me to see and know the temper and spirits
of all men, and of the best of men,&mdash;that the nation loathed
their sitting. I knew it. And, so far as I could discern,
when they were dissolved, there was not so much as the
barking of a dog, or any general or visible repining at it!
You are not a few here present that can assert this as well
as myself.</p>

<p>And that there was high cause for their dissolution, is most
evident; not only in regard there was a just fear of that
Parliament perpetuating themselves, but because it was their
<em>design</em>. Had not their heels been trod upon by importunities
from abroad, even to threats, I believe there never would
have been thoughts of rising or of going out of that room, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
the world's end. I myself was sounded, and by no mean
persons tempted; and proposals were made to me to that
very end: that the Parliament might be thus perpetuated;
that the vacant places might be supplied by new elections;&mdash;and
so continue from generation to generation.</p>

<p>There are a great many ingredients must go to the making
me happy in a husband; first, as my Cousin F. says, our
humours must agree; and to do that he must have that kind
of breeding that I have had, and used that kind of company;
that is, he must not be so much a country gentleman as to
understand nothing but hawks and dogs, and be fonder of
either than of his wife; nor of the next sort of them whose
aim reaches no further than to be Justice of Peace, and once
in his life High Sheriff, who reads no books but statutes, and
studies nothing but how to make a speech interlarded with
Latin that may amaze his disagreeing poor neighbours, and
fright them rather than persuade them into quietness. He
must not be a thing that began the world in a free school, was
sent from thence to the University, and is at his furthest when
he reaches the Inns of Court, has no acquaintance but those
of his form in these places, speaks the French he has picked
out of old laws, and admires nothing but the stories he has
heard of the revels that were kept there before his time. He
may not be a town gallant neither, that lives in a tavern and
an ordinary, that cannot imagine how an hour should be spent
without company unless it be in sleeping, that makes court to
all the women he sees, thinks they believe him, and laughs and
is laughed at equally. Nor a travelled Monsieur whose head
is all feather inside and outside, that can talk of nothing but
dances and duels, and has courage enough to wear slashes,
when everybody else dies with cold to see him. He must not
be a fool of no sort, nor peevish, nor ill-natured, nor proud,
nor covetous, and to all this must be added that he must love
me and I him as much as we are capable of loving. Without
all this, his fortune, though never so great, would not satisfy
me; and with it a very moderate one would keep me from
ever repenting my disposal....</p>

<p>I have been thinking of sending you my picture till I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
come myself; but a picture is but dull company, and that
you need not; besides I cannot tell whether it be very like
me or not, though 'tis the best I ever had drawn for me, and
Mr. Lely will have it that he never took more pains to make
a good one in his life, and that was it, I think, that spoiled
it. He was condemned for making the first that he drew of
me a little worse than I, and in making this better he has
made it as unlike as t' other. He is now, I think, at my Lord
Paget's at Marlow, where I am promised he shall draw a
picture of my Lady for me&mdash;she gives it me, she says, as the
greatest testimony of her friendship to me, for by her own
rule she is past the time of having pictures taken of her.
After eighteen, she says, there is no face but decays apparently:
I would fain have had her except such as had never been
beauties, for my comfort, but she would not.</p>

<p>One of the chief works which he [Cromwell] did was the
purging of the Ministry; of which I shall say somewhat more.
And here I suppose the reader to understand that the Synod
of Westminster was dissolved with the Parliament; and
therefore a society of ministers with some others were chosen
by Cromwell to sit at Whitehall, under the name of Triers,
who were mostly Independents, but some sober Presbyterians
with them, and had power to try all that came for
institution or induction, and without their approbation none
were admitted. This assembly of Triers examined themselves
all that were able to come up to London, but if any
were unable, or were of doubtful qualification between
worthy or unworthy, they used to refer them to some ministers
in the country where they lived, and to approve them if <em>they</em>
approved them.</p>

<p>And because this assembly of Triers is most heavily
accused and reproached by some men, I shall speak the
truth of them, and suppose my word shall be the rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
taken, because most of them took me for one of their boldest
adversaries as to their opinions, and because I was known to
disown their power, insomuch that I refused to try any under
them upon their reference, except a very few, whose importunity
and necessity moved me (they being such as for their
episcopal judgment, or some such cause, the Triers were like
to have rejected). The truth is that, though their authority
was null, and though some few over busy and over rigid
Independents among them were too severe against all that
were Arminians, and too particular in enquiring after evidences
of Sanctification in those whom they examined, and somewhat
too lax in their admission of unlearned and erroneous men
that favoured Antinomianism or Anabaptism; yet to give
them their due, they did abundance of good to the church.
They saved many a congregation from ignorant ungodly
drunken teachers; that sort of men that intended no more
in the ministry than to say a sermon, as readers say their
Common Prayers, and so patch up a few good words together
to talk the people asleep with on Sunday; and all the rest
of the week go with them to the alehouse and harden them
in their sin. And that sort of Ministers that either preached
against a holy life, or preached as men that never were
acquainted with it; all those that used the ministry but as a
common trade to live by and were never likely to convert a
soul, all these they usually rejected, and in their stead admitted
of any that were able serious Preachers, and lived a
godly life, of what tolerable opinion soever they were. So
that though they were many of them somewhat partial for
the Independents, Separatists, Fifth Monarchy men and Anabaptists,
and against the Prelatists and Arminians, yet so
great was the benefit above the hurt which they brought to
the Church, that many thousands of souls blessed God for
the faithful ministers whom they let in, and grieved when
the Prelatists afterwards cast them out again.</p>

<p class="p1 pfs100">I. <em>To Sir William Spring and Maurice Barrow, Esq.,
Cambridge, September, 1643.</em></p>

<p>I had rather have a plain russet coated Captain, that
knows what he fights for, and loves what he knows, than
that which you call a gentleman and is nothing else. I
honour a gentleman that is so indeed!</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">II. <em>To the Speaker after Naseby, June 14, 1645.</em></p>

<p>... Sir, this is none other but the hand of God; and to Him
alone belongs the glory, wherein none are to share with Him.
The General served you with all faithfulness and honour; and
the best commendation I can give him is, that I dare say he
attributes all to God and would rather perish than assume to
himself. Which is an honest and a thriving way:&mdash;and yet
as much for bravery may be given to him, in this action, as
to a man. Honest men served you faithfully in this action.
Sir, they are trusty; I beseech you in the name of God, not
to discourage them. I wish this action may beget thankfulness
and humility in all that are concerned in it. He that
ventures his life for the liberty of his country, I wish he
trust God for the liberty of his conscience, and you for the
liberty he fights for.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">III. <em>To the Speaker, September 14, 1645.</em></p>

<p>For being united in forms, commonly called Uniformity,
every Christian will for peace' sake study and do, as far as
conscience will permit. And for brethren, in things of the
mind we look for no compulsion, but that of light and reason.
In other things, God hath put the sword into the Parliament's
hands&mdash;for the terror of evil-doers and the praise of
them that do well.</p>

<p class="p1 pfs100">IV. <em>To the Lord Mayor of London, June 10, 1647.</em></p>

<p>The sum of our desires as soldiers is no other than this;
Satisfaction to our undoubted claims as soldiers; and reparation
upon those who have, to the utmost, improved all
opportunities and advantages, by false suggestions, misrepresentations
and otherwise, for the destruction of this
army with a perpetual blot of ignominy upon it.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">V. <em>To Oliver St. John, September 1, 1648.</em></p>

<p>Remember my love to my dear brother, H. Vane. I pray
he make not too much, nor I too little, of outward dispensations:&mdash;God
preserve us all, that we, in the simplicity of our
spirits, may patiently attend upon them. Let us all be not
careful what men will make of these actings. They, will
they, nill they, shall fulfil the good pleasure of God; and
we&mdash;shall serve our generations. Our rest we expect elsewhere:
that will be durable. Care we not for to-morrow,
nor for anything.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">VI. <em>To Col. R. Hammond, November 25, 1648.</em></p>

<p>My dear Friend, let us look into Providences; surely they
mean somewhat. They hang so together: have been so
constant, so clear, unclouded. Malice, swoln malice against
God's people now called "Saints": to root out their name;&mdash;and
yet they getting arms, and therein blessed with defence
and more!</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">VII. <em>To Mr. Speaker, September 4, 1650.</em></p>

<p>If there be any one that makes many poor to make a few
rich, that suits not a Commonwealth.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">VIII. <em>To Lord Wharton, September 4, 1650.</em></p>

<p>I have known my folly do good, when affection<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> has overcome
my reason.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1 pfs100">IX. <em>To the Little Parliament, 1653.</em></p>

<p>"The hand of the Lord hath done this"&mdash;it is He who hath
wrought all the salvations and deliverances we have received.
For what end! To see and know and understand together,
that he hath done and wrought all this for the good of the
whole flock. Therefore I beseech you&mdash;but I think I need
not,&mdash;have a care of the whole flock! Love the sheep,
love the lambs; love all, tender all, cherish and countenance
all, in all things that are good. And if the poorest Christian,
the most mistaken Christian, shall desire to live peaceably
and quietly under you,&mdash;I say if any shall desire but to live
a life of godliness and honesty, let him be protected.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="noindent">And indeed this hath been the way God dealt with us all
along, to keep things from our eyes all along, so that we have
seen nothing in all his dispensations long beforehand;&mdash;which
is also a witness, in some measure, to our integrity.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">X. <span class="smcap">Speech V.</span> <em>September 12, 1654</em>.</p>

<p>Indeed that hath been one of the vanities of our contest.
Every sect saith, "O, give me liberty!" But give it to him
and to his power he will not yield it to anybody else....</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">XI. <em>To the First Protectorate Parliament, January 22, 1654-55.</em></p>

<p>Is it ingenuous to ask liberty, and not to give it? What
greater hypocrisy than for those who were oppressed by the
bishops to become the greatest oppressors themselves so soon
as their yoke was removed. I could wish that they who
call for liberty now also had not too much of that spirit, if
the power were in their hands!</p>

<p>As for profane persons, blasphemers, such as preach sedition;
the contentious railers, evil speakers, who seek by evil
words to corrupt good manners, persons of loose conversation&mdash;punishment
from the Civil Magistrate ought to meet with
these. Because, if they pretend conscience; yet walking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
disorderly and not according but contrary to the gospel and
even to natural lights, they are judged of all. And their sins
being open make them subjects of the magistrate's sword,
who ought not to bear it in vain.&mdash;The discipline of the
Army <em>was</em> such, that a man would not be suffered to remain
there, of whom we could take notice that he was guilty of
such practices as those....</p>

<p>... And if it be my "liberty" to walk abroad in the fields,
or to take a journey, yet it is not my wisdom to do so when
my house is on fire!</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">XII. <em>Speech to the Major-Generals.</em></p>

<p>Why, truly, your great enemy is the Spaniard. He is a
natural enemy. He is naturally so, he is naturally so throughout,&mdash;by
reason of that great enmity that is in him against
whatsoever is of God.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Well, your danger is as you have seen. And truly I am
sorry it is so great. But I wish it to cause no despondency;&mdash;as
truly, I think it will not: for we are Englishmen; that is
one good fact.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To hang a man for six-and-eightpence, and I know not what;
to hang for a trifle and acquit murder,&mdash;is in the ministration
of the law through the ill-framing of it. I have known in my
experience abominable murders committed. And to see men
lose their lives for petty matters: this is a thing God will
reckon for.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">XIII. <em>To the Second Protectorate Parliament, January 23, 1657.</em></p>

<p>Truly, I shall in a word or two congratulate you with good
<em>you</em> are in possession of, and in some respect, I also with you.
God hath bestowed upon you, and you are in possession of
it,&mdash;Three Nations, and all that appertains to them. Which
in either a geographical, or topical consideration, are Nations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
In which also there are places of honour and consideration,
not inferior to any in the known world,&mdash;without vanity it
may be spoken. Truly God hath not made so much soil,
furnished with so many blessings, in vain! But it is a goodly
sight, if a man behold it <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">uno intuitu</i>. And therefore this is a
possession of yours, worthy of congratulation.</p>

<p>This is furnished,&mdash;give me leave to say, for I believe it is
true,&mdash;with the best People in the world, possessing so much
soil. A People in civil rights,&mdash;in respect of their rights
and privileges,&mdash;very ancient and honourable. And <em>in</em> this
People, in the midst of this People, you have, what is still
more precious, a <em>People</em> (I know every one will hear and
acknowledge it) that are to God "as the apple of His eye,"&mdash;and
He says so of them, be they many, or be they few! But
they are many. A People of the blessing of God; a People
under His safety and protection. A People calling upon the
Name of the Lord; which the Heathen do not. A People
knowing God; and a People (according to the ordinary expressions)
fearing God. And you have of this no parallel;
no, not in all the world! You have in the midst of you
glorious things.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">XIV. <em>April 13, 1657.</em></p>

<p>Truly I have, as before God, often thought that I could
not tell what my business was, nor what I was in the place I
stood in, save comparing myself to a good Constable set to
keep the peace of the parish.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">XV. <span class="smcap">Speech XI.</span> <em>April 13, 1657.</em></p>

<p>I had a very worthy friend then; and he was a very noble
person, and I know his memory is very grateful to all,&mdash;Mr.
John Hampden. At my first going out into this engagement, I
saw our men were beaten at every hand. I did indeed; and
desired him that he would make some additions to my Lord
Essex's Army, of some new regiments; and I told him I would
be serviceable to him in bringing such men in as I thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
had a spirit that would do something in the work. This is
very true that I tell you; God knows I lie not. "Your
troops," said I, "are most of them old decayed serving-men,
and tapsters, and such kind of fellows; and," said I, "their
troops are gentlemen's sons, younger sons and persons of
quality: do you think that the spirits of such base and mean
fellows will ever be able to encounter gentlemen, that have
honour and courage and resolution in them?" Truly I did
represent to him in this manner conscientiously; and truly I
did tell him: "You must get men of a spirit: and take it not
ill what I say,&mdash;I know you will not,&mdash;of a spirit that is likely
to go as far as gentlemen will go&mdash;or else you will be beaten
still."</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">XVI. <em>To the Committee of Ninety-Nine, April 21, 1657.</em></p>

<p>But surely the Laws need to be regulated! And I must
needs say, I think it would be a sacrifice acceptable to God,
upon many accounts. And I am persuaded that it is one of
the things God looks for, and would have. I confess if any
man should ask me, "Why, how would you have it done?"
I confess I do not know how. But I think verily at the
least, the delays in suits, and the excessiveness in fees, and the
costliness of suits, and those various things which I do not
know what names they bear&mdash;I hear talk of "Demurrers"
and such-like things, which I scarce know&mdash;But I say certainly,
the people are greatly suffering in this respect; they are so.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100">XVII. <em>To the Second Protectorate Parliament,
February 4, 1658.</em></p>

<p>I can say in the presence of God, in comparison with whom
we are but like poor creeping ants upon the earth,&mdash;I would
have been glad to have lived under my woodside, to have
kept a flock of sheep&mdash;rather than undertake such a Government
as this. But undertaking it by the Advice and Petition
of you, I did look that you who had offered it unto me should
make it good.</p>

<h2><a name="GEORGE_FOX_THE_QUAKER_1654" id="GEORGE_FOX_THE_QUAKER_1654"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">GEORGE FOX THE QUAKER (1654).</a></h2>

<p class="pfs90"><b>Source.</b>&mdash;<cite>Journal of George Fox.</cite> London, 1694. Vol. i.,
pp. 136-138.</p>


<p>After this I went into the country, and had several Meetings,
and came to Swannington where the soldiers came again, but
the Meeting was quiet, and the Lord's power was over all,
and the soldiers did not meddle. Then I went to Leicester,
and from Leicester to Whetstone. But before the meeting
began, there came about seventeen troopers of Colonel
Hacker's regiment, with his Marshal, and they took me up
before the meeting, though Friends were beginning to gather
together, for there were several Friends come out of several
parts. I told the Marshal, "He might let all the Friends go,
I would answer for them all;" whereupon he took me and let
all the Friends go; only Alexander Parker went along with me.
At night they had me before Col. Hacker and his Major, and
Captains, a great company of them; and a great deal of
discourse we had about the priests, and about meetings (for
at this time there was a noise of a plot against O. Cromwell)....
Then Col. Hacker asked me again "If I would go home and
stay at home?" I told him "If I should promise him so,
that would manifest that I was guilty of something, to go home
and make my home a prison. And if I went to Meetings,
they would say I broke their Order." Therefore I told them I
should go to Meetings as the Lord should order me; and
therefore could not submit to their requirings; but I said
we were a peaceable people. "Well then," said Colonel
Hacker, "I will send you to-morrow morning by six o'clock
to my Lord Protector by Captain Drury, one of his life
guard." That night I was kept a prisoner at the Marshalsea;
and the next morning by the sixth hour I was ready,
and delivered to Captain Drury. I desired he would let me
speak with Col. Hacker before I went, and he had me to his
bedside. Col. Hacker at me presently again "To go home
and keep no more Meetings." I told him I could not submit
to that.... "Then," said he, "you must go before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
Protector." Whereupon I kneeled on his Bedside and besought
the Lord to forgive him, for he was as Pilate, though
he would wash his hands; and when the day of his misery
and trial should come upon him, I bid him then remember what
I had said to him.... Afterwards when this Col. Hacker was
in prison in London, a day or two before he was executed, he
was put in mind of what he had done against the innocent....</p>

<p>Now was I carried up a prisoner by Captain Drury aforesaid
from Leicester.... So he brought me to London, and
lodged me at the Mermaid over against the Mews at Charing
Cross. And on the way as we travelled I was moved of the
Lord to warn people at the inns and places where I came of
the day of the Lord that was coming upon them. And William
Dewsbury and Marmaduke Stor being in prison at Northampton,
he let me go and visit them.</p>

<p>After Captain Drury had lodged me at the Mermaid, he
left me there and went to give the protector an account of
me. And when he came to me again, he told me the Protector
did require that I should promise not to take up a
carnal sword or weapon against him or the government as it
then was, and that I should write it, in what words I saw
good, and set my hand to it. I said little in reply to Captain
Drury. But the next morning, I was moved of the Lord to
write a paper "to the Protector by the name of Oliver Cromwell,"
wherein I did in the presence of God declare that I did
deny the wearing and drawing of a carnal sword, or any other
outward weapon against him or any man. And that I was
sent of God to stand a witness against all violence and against
the works of Darkness, to turn the people from Darkness to
Light and to bring them from the occasion of war and fighting
to the peaceable Gospel.... When I had written what the
Lord had given me to write, I set my name to it and gave it
to Captain Drury to give to O. Cromwell, which he did.</p>

<p>Then after some time Captain Drury brought me before the
Protector himself at Whitehall. It was in a morning before
he was dressed.... When I came in, I was moved to say
"Peace be in this House," and I bid him keep in the fear of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
God that he might receive wisdom from him.... I spake
much to him of Truth, and a great deal of Discourse I had
with him about Religion; wherein he carried himself very
moderately. But he said we quarrelled with the priests
whom he called Ministers. I said we did not quarrel with
them, but they quarrelled with me and my friends. "But,"
I said, "if we own the Prophets, Christ and the Apostles, we
cannot hold up such teachers, prophets and shepherds, as
the Prophets, Christ and the Apostles declared against...."
As I spake, he would several times say it was very good,
and it was truth. I told him that all Christendom (so-called)
had the Scriptures, but they wanted the power and spirit
that they had which gave forth the Scriptures.... Many
more words I had with him; but people coming in, I drew a
little back. And as I was turning, he catched me by the hand
and with tears in his eyes, said "Come again to my House,
for if thou and I were but an hour of a day together, we should
be nearer one to the other," adding, that he wished me no
more ill than he did to his own soul. I told him; if he did,
he wronged his own soul. And I bid him hearken to God's
voice, ... and if he did not hear God's voice, his heart would
be hardened. And he said: it was true. Then went I out.
And when Captain Drury came out after me, he told me his
Lord Protector said, I was at liberty, and might go whither I
would. Then I was brought into a great Hall where the Protector's
gentlemen were to dine, and I asked them what they
did bring me thither for. They said it was by the Protector's
order that I might dine with them. I bid them let the Protector
know I would not eat a bit of his bread nor drink a
sup of his drink. When he heard this he said: "Now I see
there is a people risen and come up, that I cannot win either
with gifts, honours, offices or places: but all other sects and
people I can." But it was told him again, that we had forsook
our own and were not like to look for such things from him.</p>

<p>Now I, being set at liberty, went up to the Inn again,
where Captain Drury had at first lodged me. This Captain
Drury, though he sometimes carried fairly, was an enemy to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
me and to truth and opposed it ... and would scoff at trembling
and call us Quakers, as the Presbyterians and Independents
had nicknamed us before. But afterwards he came on a
time and told me, that as he was lying on his bed to rest himself
in the daytime, a sudden trembling seized on him that
his joints knocked together ... and he was so shaken that he
had not strength enough to rise. But he felt the power of the
Lord was upon him and he tumbled off his bed and cried to
the Lord and said, he would never speak against the Quakers
more, such as trembled at the word of God.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">May it please Your Highness</span>,<br />

<span class="pad3">How</span> I have spent some hours of the leisure your Highness
has been pleased to give me, the following paper will give
your Highness an account; how you will please to interpret
it, I cannot tell; but I can with confidence say, my intention
in it is to procure your Highness that justice nobody yet
does you, and to let the people see, the longer they defer it,
the greater injury they do both themselves and you. To
your Highness justly belongs the honour of dying for the
people; and it cannot choose but be an unspeakable consolation
to you, in the last moments of your life, to consider with
how much benefit to the world you are like to leave it. It
is then only, my Lord, that the title you now usurp will be
truly yours: you will then be indeed the Deliverer of your
country, and free it from a bondage little inferior to that
from which Moses delivered his. You will then be that true
Reformer which you would now be thought; religion shall
then be restored, liberty asserted, and parliaments have those
privileges they have fought for. We shall then hope that
other laws will have place besides those of the sword, and
justice shall be otherwise defined than as the Will and Pleasure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
of the Strongest; and we shall then hope men will keep oaths
again, and not have the necessity of being false and perfidious
to preserve themselves and to be like their rulers. All this
we hope from your Highness's happy expiration, who are the
true father of your country: for while you live, we can call
nothing ours, and it is from your death that we hope for our
inheritances. Let this consideration arm and fortify your
Highness's mind against the fear of death and the terrors of
your evil conscience, that the good you will do by your death
will somewhat balance the evils of your life. And if, in the
black catalogue of high malefactors, few can be found that
have lived more to the affliction and disturbance of mankind
than your Highness hath done; yet your greatest enemies
will not deny, but there are likewise as few that have expired
more to the universal benefit of mankind, than your Highness
is like to do. To hasten this great good is the chief end of
my writing this paper, and if it have the effects I hope it will,
your Highness will be quickly out of reach of men's malice
and your enemies will only be able to wound you in your
memory, which strokes you will not feel. That your Highness
may speedily be in this security, is the universal wish of your
grateful country; this is the desire and prayer of the good
and of the bad, and, it may be, is the only thing wherein all
sects and factions do agree in their devotions, and is our only
Common Prayer. But amongst all that put in their requests
and supplications for your Highness's speedy deliverance
from all earthly troubles, none is more assiduous, nor more
fervent than he that (with the rest of this nation) hath the
honour to be, may it please your Highness,</p>

<p>I have no mind to give an ill character of Cromwell; for in
his conversation towards me he was ever friendly; tho' at
the latter end of the day finding me ever incorrigible, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
having some inducements to suspect me a tamperer, he was
sufficiently rigid. The first time that ever I took notice of
him, was in the very beginning of the Parliament held in
November, 1640, when I vainly thought myself a courtly
young Gentleman: (for we Courtiers valued our selves much
upon our good clothes). I came one morning into the House
well clad, and perceived a Gentleman speaking (whom I
knew not) very ordinarily apparelled; for it was a plain cloth
suit, which seemed to have been made by an ill country-tailor;
his linen was plain, and not very clean; and I remember a
speck or two of blood upon his little band, which was not
much larger than his collar; his hat was without a hat-band:
his stature was of a good size, his sword stuck close
to his side, his countenance swoln and reddish, his voice
sharp and untunable, and his eloquence full of fervour; for
the subject matter would not bear much of reason; it being
in behalf of a servant of Mr. Prynne's, who had dispersed
libells against the Queen for her dancing and such innocent
and courtly sports; and he aggravated the imprisonment
of this man by the Council Table unto that height, that one
would have believed the very Government itself had been
in great danger by it. I sincerely profess it lessened much
my reverence unto that great council; for he was very
much hearkened unto. And yet I lived to see this very
Gentleman, whom out of no ill will to him I thus describe,&mdash;by
multiplied good successes, and by real (but usurped)
power, (having had a better tailor, and more converse
among good company)&mdash;in my own eye, when for six weeks
together I was a prisoner in his Serjeant's hands, and daily
waited at Whitehall, appear of a great and majestic deportment
and comely presence. Of him therefore I will say
no more, but that verily I believe, he was extraordinarily
designed for those extraordinary things, which one while most
wickedly and facinorously he acted, and at another as successfully
and greatly performed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

<h3 class="pg">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
